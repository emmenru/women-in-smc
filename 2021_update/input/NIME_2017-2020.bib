However, the use of industrial strength voice coil actuators provides a compelling alternative given a desirable set of heterogeneous features and requirements that span traditional devices.  Their characteristics such as high acceleration and accurate positioning enable the exploration of rendering highly accurate and expressive percussion performances.}

An evaluation of our design demonstrated that the sensors pressure response profile fits a logarithmic curve (R = 0.98). The input delay of the sensor is 2.1ms. The average absolute error in one direction of the sensor was measured to be less than 10% of one of the matrix's strips (M = 1.8mm, SD = 1.37mm). We intend this technology to be easy to use and implement by experts and novices alike: We ensure the ease of use by providing a host application that tracks touch points and passes these on as OSC or MIDI messages. We make our design easy to implement by providing open source software and hardware and by choosing evaluation methods that use accessible tools, making quantitative comparisons between different branches of the design easy. We chose to work with textile to take advantage of its tactile properties and its malleability of form and to pay tribute to textile's rich cultural heritage. }

Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations.

  abstract = {Learning to play the transverse flute is not an easy task, at least not for everyone.  Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate and thereby produce sound.  In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet.  For a beginner, this can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lips position.  This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible and measurable.  The augmented flute shows information about the area covered by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it shows graphically the air jet direction.  Additionally, the augmented flute provides directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced flutists.}

This approach breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to transduce gesture into sonic output.  We outline a method for generating multimodal terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain. We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.}

We implement supervised learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, binary decision tree, and artificial neural network) to estimate hand motion data, which is not typically captured by the sensor. Two problems are addressed: 1) the sensor cannot detect overlapping hands 2) The sensor's limited detection range. Training examples included 7 kinds of overlapping hand gestures as well as hand trajectories where a hand goes out of the sensor's range. The overlapping gestures were treated as a classification problem and the best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with 62% accuracy. The out-of-range problem was treated first as a clustering problem to group the training examples into a small number of trajectory types, then as a classification problem to predict trajectory type based on the hand's motion before going out of range. The best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with an accuracy of 30%. The prediction models were implemented in an ongoing multimedia electroacoustic vocal performance and an educational project named Embodied Sonic Meditation (ESM).  }

The Review was conducted with demonstrations by groups of students supervised by different Lecturer, in each case focusing on a different strategy to create a connection between Sound, Music, Acoustics, Space and Architectural Design. There was an assumption that the core working process would have to include the design of a new musical instrument, which in some cases became the final deliverable of the Studio and in other cases a step in a process that leads to a different outcome (such as an architectural Design, a performance or social experiment). One other relevant aspect was that Digital technology was used in the design and fabrication of the physical instruments' prototypes, but in very few cases, it was used in the actual generation or enhancement of sound, with the instruments relying almost exclusively in acoustic and mechanical sound.  }

However, the subjective nature of these terms, and the variability with respect to musical context often leads to inconsistencies in their definition. In this study, a model is proposed for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75% mean accuracy.}

Designed in the form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer's muscle movements into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals.  The primary goal in designing Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract for Biostomp can be viewed at vimeo.com/biostomp/video.}

The human skeletal data is acquired through a Microsoft Kinect v2.  The movement of the student is mirrored through an abstract skeletal figure and instructions are provided through a virtual teacher.  Posture deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual feedback modality with no feedback leads to an increase in posture accuracy (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.047). Reaction card feedback and expert interviews indicate that the feedback is considered fun and useful for training independently from the teacher.}

From childhood to adultness, playfulness is often associated with remarkable positive experiences related to fun, pleasure, intimate social activities, imagination, and creativity. Perhaps not surprisingly, playfulness has been recurrently used in NIME designs as a strategy to engage people, often non-expert, in short term musical activities. Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support their decisions.  To address this issue, we follow a design rationale approach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new design space. We then use this design space to discuss potential guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool&#8212;called the "Voice Reaping Machine". Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works in the literature.}

An important innovation is the ability to learn how the improvised accompaniment should respond to variations in the melody performance, using tempo and embellishment complexity as features, resulting in a truly interactive performance within a conventional musical framework. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations, showing that the learned improviser performs more interactive, musical, and human-like accompaniment compared with the less responsive, rule-based baseline algorithm.}

  abstract = {A new hybrid approach to digital keyboard playing is presented, where the actual acoustic sounds from a digital keyboard are captured with contact microphones and applied as excitation signals to a digital model of a prepared piano, i.e., an extended wave-guide model of strings with the possibility of stopping and muting the strings at arbitrary positions. The parameters of the string model are controlled through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping.  The instrument is evaluated from a performing musician's perspective, and emerging playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument, yet with new kinds of control.  The contributions are two-fold. First, the use of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of "inside piano" playing, using multitouch keyboard data, allows for performance techniques going far beyond conventional keyboard playing.}

The loop pedal, is still the most used device for those types of performances, accounting for many of the cover songs performances on youtube, but not all kinds of song apply.  Unlike a common loop pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization.  In its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage, we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints, the new RL deals with pop music and has been already used in several in live concert situations.}

Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.}

Instrument augmentation is a common approach for designing new interfaces for musical expression, as shown through hyperinstrument research.  New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes.  The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment.  The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer's hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.}

This paper will focus specifically on the combination of pitch data treated within tonal models and the detection of physical performance gestures using timbral feature extraction algorithms. We discuss how these tracked gestures may be connected to concepts and dynamic relationships from embodied cognition, expanding on performative models for pitch and timbre spaces. Finally, we explore how these ideas support connections between sonic, formal and performative dimensions. This includes instrumental technique detection scenes and mapping strategies aimed at bridging music performance gestures across physical and conceptual planes. }

It argues that the conventional model of composer-performer-listener, and the underlying mid-20th century metaphor of music as communication upon which it relies, cannot reflect the richness of interaction and possibility afforded by interactive digital technologies.  Building on Paul Lansky's vision of an expanded and dynamic social network, an alternative, ecological view of music-making is presented, in which meaning emerges not from "messages" communicated between individuals, but instead from the "noise" that arises through the uncertainty in their interactions. However, in our tendency in NIME to collapse the various roles in this network into a single individual, we place the increased potential afforded by digital systems at risk. Using examples from the author's NIME practices, the paper uses a practice-based methodology to describe approaches to designing instruments that respond to the technologies that form the interfaces of the network, which can include scores and stylistic conventions. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that a repertoire&#8212;a seemingly anachronistic concept&#8212;and a corresponding repertoire-driven approach to creating NIMEs can in fact be a catalyst for invention and creativity.}

As physical and digital assemblages, interfaces also act as traces of the authoring entities that created them. Their intentions, likes, dislikes, and ultimate determinations of what is creatively useful all get embedded into the available choices of the interface. In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined.}

This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.}

While they may increase the transparency and expressiveness of instruments, they may also result in limited agency, for musicians as well as for spectators. This problem becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces.  Most existing solutions to these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small screens).  Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual objects.  Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces. We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing gestural musical instruments.}

We contacted 97 DMI makers that presented a new instrument at five successive editions of NIME (2010-2014); 70 answered. They were asked to indicate the original motivation for designing the DMI and to present information about its uptake. Results confirmed that most of the instruments have difficulties establishing themselves. Also, they were asked to reflect on the specific factors that facilitated and those that hindered instrument longevity. By grounding these reflections on existing reserach on NIME and HCI, we propose a series of design considerations for future DMIs.  }

Vokinesis, a system for real-time rhythm and pitch modification and control of singing is presented.  Pitch and vocal effort are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The concept of Syllabic Control Points (SCP) is introduced for timing and rhythm control.  A chain of phonetic syllables have two types of temporal phases : the steady phases, which correspond to the vocalic nuclei, and the transient phases, which correspond to the attacks and/or codas. Thus, syllabic rhythm control methods need transient and steady phases control points, corresponding to the ancient concept of the arsis and thesis is prosodic theory. SCP allow for accurate control of articulation, using hand or feet. In the \emph{Tap mode}, SCP are triggered by pressing and releasing a control button. In the \emph{Fader mode}, continuous variation of the SCP sequencing rate is controlled with expression pedals.  Vokinesis has been tested successfully in musical performances, using both syllabic rhythm control modes. This system opens new musical possibilities, and can be extended to other types of sounds beyond voice. }

In this paper we replace the expense of circular breathing and lip buzzing with electronic excitation, thus creating an electro-acoustic didgeridoo or electronic didgeridoo. Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers and controllable from a computer. To properly drive the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the need for circular breathing.  }

  abstract = {This paper presents a knowledge-based, data-driven method for using data describing action-sound couplings collected from a group of people to generate multiple complex mappings between the performance movements of a musician and sound synthesis.  This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters.  A series of sound stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument they are given.  Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus.  The dataset created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define mappings for real-time performance.  To better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.}

While producing EDM, creating the drum track tends to be delicate, yet labor intensive work.  In this work we present a touch-interface-based prototype with the goal to simplify this task.  The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances.  Starting with a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated.  The interface provides simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns.  Variations are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library.  To evaluate the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in EDM production was conducted.  It was found that participants responded positively to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns.  Furthermore, the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations and live performances.}

In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service. The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the 60's physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming videos from the platform as musical materials in computer music and introduce a live coding environment that we developed for real-time improvisation.  }

Each of these instruments is a five-voice granular synthesizer which processes a different sound source to give each a unique timbre and range. The performer interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay under the performer's fingertips.  The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2.  The nature of the JoyStyx construction causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry, leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more ``analog'' or ``natural'' sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert, the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.}

To broaden access to designing unique languages-as-instruments we developed an online programming environment that offers liveness in the process of language design as well as performance.  The editor utilizes the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism for language design, and a virtual machine featuring collaborative multitasking for execution, in order to support a diversity of language concepts and affordances.

In contrast to this approach, this paper outlines a philosophical position concerning the relationship between instruments and performers in improvisational contexts that recognises the agency of the instrument within the performance process. It builds on a post-phenomenological understanding of the human/instrument relationship in which the human and the instrument are understood as co-defining entities without fixed boundaries; an approach that actively challenges notions of instrumental mastery and &#8216;absolute control'. This paper then takes a practice-based approach to outline how such philosophical concerns have fed into the design of an augmented, actuated cello system, The Feral Cello, that has been designed to explicitly explore these concerns through practice.  }

Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to refer to this category. There are no "plug-n-play" solutions for a BCMI, these kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial expressions, from the user's brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the device's adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also question its reliability and robustness.}

In preparation for its deployment in a real-world performance setting the team conducted a user study aimed to define relevant constraints of the Google Glass display. Based on the observed data, a conductor part from an existing laptop orchestra piece was retrofitted, thereby replacing the laptop with a Google Glass running Glasstra and a similarly inconspicuous forearm-mounted Wiimote controller. Below we present findings from the user study that have informed the design of the visual display, as well as multi-perspective observations from a series of real-world performances, including the designer, user, and the audience. We use findings to offer a new hypothesis, an inverse uncanny valley or what we refer to as uncanny mountain pertaining to audience's potential distraction with the technology within the context of a live technology-mediated music performance as a function of minimizing on-stage technological footprint.}

  abstract = {While most musical robots that are capable of playing the drum kit utilise a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-hat, with the additional degree of motion provided by its pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians to use.  This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously calibrate the hi-hat's action both before and during a musical performance. This is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms.  This new approach allows musicians to create expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment. }

  abstract = {Tangible user interfaces empower artists, boost their creative expression and enhance performing art. However, most of them are designed to work with a set of rules, many of which require advanced skills and target users above a certain age. Here we present a comparative and quantitative study of using TUIs as an alternative teaching tool in experimenting with and creating soundscapes with children. We describe an informal interactive workshop involving schoolchildren. We focus on the development of playful uses of technology to help children empirically understand audio feature extraction basic techniques. We promote tangible interaction as an alternative learning method in the creation of synthetic soundscape based on sounds recorded in a natural outdoor environment as main sources of sound. We investigate how schoolchildren perceive natural sources of sound and explore practices that reuse prerecorded material through a tangible interactive controller. We discuss the potential benefits of using TUIs as an alternative empirical method for tangible learning and interaction design, and its impact on encouraging and motivating creativity in children. We summarize our findings and review children's biehavioural indicators of engagement and enjoyment in order to provide insight to the design of TUIs based on user experience.}

  abstract = {This research investigates how applying interaction constraints to digital music instruments (DMIs) affects the way that experienced music performers collaborate and find creative ways to make live improvised music on stage. The constraints are applied in two forms: i) Physically implemented on the instruments themselves, and ii) hidden rules that are defined on a network between the instruments and triggered depending on the musical actions of the performers. Six experienced musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance. Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music may not fit with performers' true intentions. It was also found that when external musical material is introduced to guide the performers into a collective convergence, it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out of context.}

Multi-layer fabric sensors that detect touch, proximity, electric field, pressure, and stretch are machine-sewn in a keyboard pattern on a stretchable substrate. The result is a fabric-based musical controller that combines both the discrete controls of a keyboard and various continuous controls from the embedded fabric sensors. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with physical and non-contact gestures: physical by pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting the keys or the fabric and non-contact by hovering and waving towards/against the keyboard and an electromagnetic source. We have also developed additional fabric-based modular interfaces such as a ribbon-controller and trackpad, allowing performers to add more expressive and continuous controls. This paper will discuss implementation strategies for our system-on-textile, fabric-based sensor developments, as well as sensor-computer interfacing and musical mapping examples of this multi-modal and expressive fabric keyboard.  }

The classic foot activated effect pedals that are used to alter the sound of the instrument are stationary, forcing the performer to return to the same location in order to interact with the pedals. This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the effect pedals anywhere on the stage. By designing a foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller, we kept the strongest part of the classical pedal design, while allowing the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance has been recorded and compared, and their opinion has been investigated through questionnaire and interview. The results of the experiment showed that, in theory, foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller can replace standard effect pedals and at the same time provide more mobility on a stage. }

The project was conducted by both the students of the music therapy and multimedia composition programs and has thus offered rare insights into the dynamic of such undertakings covering both the therapeutic underpinnings, as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular result.  DJster, the engine we used for the generative processes is based on Clarence Barlow's probabilistic algorithms. Equipped with the proper periphery (sensors, sound modules and spatializers), we looked at three different scenarios, each requiring specific musical and technological solutions. The pilot was concluded by a symposium in 2017 and the development of a prototype system. The symposium yielded a diagram detailing the circular dynamic of the factors involved in this particular project, while the prototype was demoed in 2016 at the HfMT facilities. The system will be installed permanently at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in June 2017.}

As a large degree of DMI evaluation is concerned with exploring the subjective experience: ergonomics, action-sound mappings and control intimacy; User Experience (UX) methods are increasingly being utilised to analyse an individual's experience of new musical instruments, from which we can extract meaningful, robust findings and subsequently generalised and useful recommendations. However, many music interaction evaluations remain informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014 -- 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to highlight methods from UX's widening field of research that have not yet been explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.}

  abstract = {The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument designed to reinterpret and reflect upon the sounds of the instruments it is performed in collaboration with. At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques and settings. These are explored through case studies in a five year history of Fragment String-based compositions and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations of these interactions and their sonic output.  }

The overall user experience offered by the technology can be described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram.  &#160; More specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the dynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together determine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of this visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides real-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved by the user.  Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a floating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly overlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are symbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up within a grid if the instance is providing output to the user.  &#160; We discuss the system's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications. This from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the uniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of new forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently presented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.}

However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle but important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers ``go beyond the obvious'', and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of ``sound and feeling'' are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.}

The string-plate model is formulated in a way that prioritises its parametric explorability. Where the roles of creating performance gestures and designing instruments are traditionally separated, such a design provides a continuum across these domains. The string-plate model, its real-time implementation, and the control interface are described, and the system is preliminarily evaluated through informal observations of how musicians engage with the system.}

As we describe here, SATIE is designed for improved scalability: minimum dependency between nodes in the audio DSP graph for parallel audio computation, controlling sound objects by groups and load balancing computation of geometry that allow to reduce the number of messages for controlling simultaneously a high number of sound sources. The paper presents SATIE along with example use case scenarios. Our initial work demonstrates SATIE's flexibility, and has provided us with novel sonic sensations such as ``audio depth of field'' and real-time sound swarming.}

In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability.  Examples drawn from our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for artistic creation and reusability.

  abstract = {We present here GeKiPe, a gestural interface for musical expression, combining images and sounds, generated and controlled in real time by a performer. GeKiPe is developed as part of a creation project, exploring the control of virtual instruments through the analysis of gestures specific to instrumentalists, and to percussionists in particular. GeKiPe was used for the creation of a collaborative stage performance (Sculpt), in which the musician and their movements are captured by different methods (infrared Kinect cameras and gesture-sensors on controller gloves). The use of GeKiPe as an alternate sound and image controller allowed us to combine body movement, musical gestures and audiovisual expressions to create challenging collaborative performances.}

  abstract = {Many musical instruments exhibit an inherent latency or delayed auditory feedback (DAF) between actuator activation and the occurrence of sound.  We investigated how DAF (73ms and 250ms) affects musically trained (MT) and non-musically trained (NMT) people's ability to synchronize the audible strum of an actuated guitar to a metronome at 60bpm and 120bpm. The long DAF matched a subdivision of the overall tempo. We compared their performance using two different input devices with feedback before or on activation. While 250ms DAF hardly affected musically trained participants, non-musically trained participants' performance declined substantially both in mean synchronization error and its spread. Neither tempo nor input devices affected performance.}

Specifically, the engine combines a system for recognising and responding to musical trigger phrases along with a dynamic digital score renderer. This tool chain allows for the composer's original scoring to include notational elements such as trigger phrases to be automatically extracted to auto-configure the engine for live performance. We reflect holistically on the development process to date and highlight the emerging challenges and opportunities. For example, this includes the potential for further developing the workflow around the scoring process and the ways in which support for musical triggers has shaped the compositional approach.}

NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology, engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies. Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing an alternative approach: musical organics .  Musical organics is a philosophical attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the Reactable.  This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical culture.}

The impulse response is obtained correlating a noise signal injected in the object through an acoustic actuator with the signal received from an acoustic sensor placed on the object. We also present an efficient multichannel implementation of the system, which enables further creative applications beyond audio filtering, including tangible signal patching and sound spatialization.}

Unlike other mechatronic guitar instruments that perform pre-programmed music automatically, this guitar allows the human and actuators to produce sounds jointly; there exists a distributed control between the human and robotic components. The interaction allows human performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with a rhythmic pattern.  Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports real-time interactive improvising.}

  abstract = {This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio processing are utilized.  Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument's sound is modified by the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.}

The goals of direct music making, meaningful communication, intuitive interfaces, and technical transparency led to a design that purposefully limits the number of participating audience members, balances the tradeoffs between interface simplicity and control, and prioritizes the role of a graphics and animation display system that is both functional and aesthetically integrated. Survey results from the audience and stage musicians show a successful and engaging experience, and also illuminate the path towards future improvements.}

Originally musebot development focused on software-only ensembles of musical agents, coded by a community of developers. More recent experiments have explored humans interfacing with musebot ensembles in various ways: including through electronic interfaces in which parametric control of high-level musebot parameters are used; message-based interfaces which allow human users to communicate with musebots in their own language; and interfaces through which musebots have jammed with human musicians. Here we report on the recent developments of human interaction with musebot ensembles and reflect on some of the implications of these developments for the design of metacreative music systems.}

At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected interview evidence about the participants' experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach.  The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment.  The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds so that there is space for interplay between the two.}

The software is used in the development a series of recordings, similarly titled as AM MODE. Programmed in Max/MSP, the software uses live audio input from individual instruments within the drum set as control parameters for modulation synthesis. By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers, audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications. The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming a sonic hybrid.  }

Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.}

Its unique sound is made through two radio frequency oscillators that, when operating at almost identical frequencies, gravitate towards each other. Ultimately, this pull alters the sine wave, creating the signature sound of the theremin. The Theremin Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremin's ability, enabling it to produce five distinct new textures beyond the original.  It also features a looping system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.   }

Borrowing the best from TidalCycles, Siren augments the pattern creation process by introducing various interface level features: a multi-channel sequencer, local and global parameters, mathematical expressions, and pattern history. It presents new opportunities for recording, refining, and reusing the playback information with the pattern roll component. Subsequently, the paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of Siren in the context of user interface design principles, which originates from the cognitive dimensions framework for musical notation design.}

The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers.  The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators. }

Our objective was to design a device that affords exploratory modes of interaction with the performer's surroundings, as well as precise control over microtonal pitch content and other concomitant parameters.  The instrument is comprised of a hand-held wand, containing two piezo-electric transducers affixed to a pair of metal probes.  The performer uses the wand to physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals.  Input materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis, in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances.  We achieved gestural control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch.  As a unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partch's “monophonic fabric” of Just Intonation—specifically his conception of odentities, udentities, and a variable numerary nexus.  This system classifies pitch content based upon intervallic structures found in both the overtone and undertone series.  Our paper details the procedural challenges in designing the Harmonic Wand.}

  abstract = {Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments. These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation, timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical expression stems from the “transitive” perspective that musical expression is an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical expression focus on an “intransitive” perspective, where musical meaning is generated as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative capabilities unique to robotic instruments.}

Our project, Interactive Tango Milonga, an interactive Argentine tango dance system for social dance addresses these challenges in order to innovate connection, the feeling of intense relation between dance partners, music, and the larger tango community. }

  abstract = {This paper presents an experiment to investigate how new types of vocal practices can affect psychophysiological activity. We know that health can influence the voice, but can a certain use of the voice influence health through modification of mental and physical state? This study took place in the setting of the Vocal Vibrations installation. For the experiment, participants engage in a multi sensory vocal exercise with a limited set of guidance to obtain a wide spectrum of vocal performances across participants. We compare characteristics of those vocal practices to the participant's heart rate, breathing rate, electrodermal activity and mental states. We obtained significant results suggesting that we can correlate psychophysiological states with characteristics of the vocal practice if we also take into account biographical information, and in particular mea- surement of how much people “like” their own voice.}

  abstract = {In order to facilitate access to playing music spontaneously, the prototype of an instrument which allows a more natural learning approach was developed as part of the research project Drum-Dance-Music-Machine. The result was a modular system consisting of several VST plug-ins, which on the one hand provides a drum interface to create sounds and tones and on the other hand generates or manipulates music through dance movement, in order to simplify the understanding of more abstract characteristics of music. This paper describes the development of a new software concept for the prototype, which since then has been further developed and evaluated several times. This will improve the maintainability and extensibility of the system and eliminate design weaknesses. To do so, the existing system first will be analyzed and requirements for a new framework, which is based on the concepts of event driven architecture and dependency injection, will be defined. The components are then transferred to the new system and their performance is assessed. The approach chosen in this case study and the lessons learned are intended to provide a viable solution for solving similar problems in the development of modular VST-based NIMEs.}

This type of neural network has a compact structure and is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties, we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work, we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery of the CTRNN creative search space.}

Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of ‘hijacking' formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.}

Three detailed examples -- biocontrollers, accordion-inspired instruments, and a networked intelligent controller --  illustrate how a complex suite of factors throughout the design, composition and performance processes can influence the development of idiomatic gestures. We argue that the explicit consideration of idiomatic gestures throughout the life cycle of new instruments can facilitate the emergence of style and give rise to performances that can develop rich layers of meaning.}

  abstract = {Machine learning and deep learning has recently made a large impact in the artistic community. In many of these applications however, the model is often used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output defined in the synth engine.  The system relies on learning these movements from a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output, our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the Lightpad instrument.}

While recent research has started to experiment with the capabilities offered by modern interfaces, there are no examples for productive applications such as audio-morphing. Audio-morphing as a special field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization. Using multi-touch gestures to manipulate audio-morphing in a visual way, sound design and music production becomes more unrestricted and creative.}

Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However, the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments. Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not “tone deaf”. Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30% faster compared with learning from videos.}

Not all new musical instruments are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition of being new. So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers' practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.}

This is a difficult task to achieve: many new instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performer's movement translates into the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians. In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness. This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result only seems to be true for expert players.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the prevailing longevity problem of digital musical instruments (DMIs) in NIME research and design by proposing a holistic system design approach. Despite recent efforts to examine the main contributing factors of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to remedy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts establishing themselves, their design processes and technologies. However, few existing studies have attempted to proactively build a community around technological platforms for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and activities necessary for a budding community. We observe that such attempts while important in their undertaking, are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic factors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must not only take into account a target community but it may also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sustains artistic practice.}

Each audio track has four two-bar loops which play in synchronisation switchable by its respective octave's first four black keys. The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface. All subjects agreed that all tools had creative performance potential that could be developed by further practice.}

CPGs are neural networks which generate adaptive rhythmic signals. They simulate structures in animals which underly behaviours such as heartbeat, gut peristalsis and complex motor control. Neurythmic is the first such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties of the CPG networks used (Matsuoka's Neural Oscillator), and describe methods for their control. Evaluation with expert and professional musicians shows that Neurythmic is a versatile tool, adapting well to a range of quite different musical approaches.}

  abstract = {Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface, finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between compositions that used either interface.}

In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor – two motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters. Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system. When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.}

This research compared three approaches to capturing hand gestures where the shape of the hand, i.e. the relative positions and angles of finger joints, are an important part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages for music applications. This study compared three approaches, using optical, inertial and muscular information, with three sets of 5 hand postures (i.e. static gestures) and gesture recognition algorithms applied to the device data, aiming to determine which methods are most effective.}

After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: “why do musicians want to use this instrument?” and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument.

The recent increase in interest and investment in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel methods for musicians to create and interact with music. To this end, a number of nontraditional instruments have been constructed that enable musicians to control sound production beyond pitch and volume, integrating filtering, musical effects, etc. Wii Remotes (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use in maker communities, including laptop orchestras, for their robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music creation. In this paper, the authors present a new controller design, based on the WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-centric music performance. Based on the pilot-study data, the new controller offers unrestricted two-hand gesture production, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.}

  abstract = {In digital musical instrument design, different tools and methods offer a variety of approaches for constraining the exploration of musical gestures and sounds. Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to further investigate and extend this approach.}

This provides a proof-of-concept that this robotic fabrication technique might be a candidate method for creating novel metallic ideophones that are based on sheet deformations. Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication. In this paper we discuss this technique as well as aspects of the geometry of stadium cymbals and their impact on the resulting instrument.}

Through two experiments, the perceptual significance and overall musical contribution of the addition of haptic feedback in a listening context was evaluated. Subjects preferred listening to the classical guitar presentation with the addition of haptic feedback and the addition of haptic feedback contributed to listeners' engagement with a performance. The results of the experiments and their implications are discussed in this paper.}

Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed varying degrees of `guitar-likeness', based either on the form and aesthetics of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures.}

The intervention lasted three weeks during which the participant had a fully functional electrical guitar fitted with a strumming device controlled by a foot pedal at his free disposal. The device replaced right strumming of the strings, and the study showed that the participant, who was highly motivated, played 20 sessions despite system latency and reduced musical expression. He incorporated his own literature and equipment into his playing routine and improved greatly as the study progressed. He was able to play alone and keep a steady rhythm in time with backing tracks that went as fast as 120bpm.

Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this first iteration "Cabled Madness" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration "Onward to Mars" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit backpack. Now 10 years on, a new {robotcowboy 2.0} system powers a third iteration with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author's open-source iOS application which runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller support, and Open Sound Control communication.

The installation was built around the idea of exploring `inverse' sonic microinteraction, that is, controlling sounds by the micromotion observed when attempting to stand still. It consisted of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind, and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional `performance' technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound, and vibration, and that the `inverse' control of the instrument was both challenging and pleasant.}

The CubeHarmonic is a musical application of the Rubik's cube, with notes on each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get different chords and chord sequences. Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik's cube, and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a recreational tool.}

It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.}

  abstract = {The process of learning to play a string instrument is a notoriously difficult task. A new student to the instrument is faced with mastering multiple, interconnected physical movements in order to become a skillful player. In their development, one measure of a players quality is their tone, which is the result of the combination of the physical characteristics of the instrument and their technique in playing it. This paper describes preliminary research into creating an intuitive, real-time device for evaluating the quality of tone generation on the cello: a ``timbre-tuner'' to aid cellists evaluate their tone quality. Data for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at different pitches on the A string was created. Results from informal listening tests support the use of the harmonic centroid as an appropriate measure for tone quality.}

It takes form as a swelling sea anemone, while the sounds it produces recall the quagmire of a digital ocean.  The sculpture responds to changing light conditions with a dynamic mix of audio tracks, mapping volume to light level.  People passing by the sculpture, or directly engaging it by creating light and shadows with their smart phone flashlights, will trigger the audio.  At the same time, it automatically adapts to gradual environment light changes, such as the rise and fall of the sun.  The piece was inspired by the searching gestures people make, and emotions they have while, idly browsing content on their smart devices.  It was created through an interdisciplinary collaboration between a musician, an interaction designer, and a ceramicist.}

Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.}

In a course of performance-led research four prototypes were built and analyzed them using concepts from NIME and creative collaboration literature. Based on this analysis it was found that the systems should 1) provide a commonly modifiable visual representation of musical data for both coder and non-coder, and 2) provide some independent means of sound production for each user, giving the non-coder the ability to slow down and make non-realtime decisions for greater performance flexibility. }

Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the ‘sensor layer' brings with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response. }

This work investigates a series of discrete-time chaotic maps, which have the potential to generate intriguing sounds when they are adjusted to be on the edge of chaos.  With these chaotic maps as studied historically, the edge of chaos tends to be razor-thin, which can make it difficult to employ them for making new musical instruments.  The authors therefore suggest connecting chaotic maps with digital waveguides, which (1) make it easier to synthesize harmonic tones and (2) make it harder to fall off of the edge of chaos while playing a musical instrument.  The authors argue therefore that this technique widens the razor-thin edge of chaos into a musical highway.}

  abstract = {In computer or electroacoustic music, it is often the case that the compositional act and the parametric control of the underlying synthesis algorithms or hardware are not separable from each other. In these situations, composition and control of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy approach. }

Participants were filmed and interviewed for the later analysis of their different multimodal associations about music. Our initial hypothesis was that most of the physical mock-ups would be similar to the sound-producing objects that participants would identify in the musical pieces. Although the majority of artifacts clearly showed correlated design trajectories, our results indicate that a relevant number of participants intuitively decided to engineer alternative solutions emphasizing their personal design preferences. Therefore, in this paper we present and discuss the workshop format, its results and the possible applications for designing new musical interfaces.}

The pendulum's movement causes the liquid in the glass to slosh back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass sounds are produced by driving audio-range signals through the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to the glass surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the glass vibrates, the sloshing liquid periodically changes the glass's resonance frequencies and dampens the glass, thus modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.}

This features allow for quick instrument customisation for different use cases,

  abstract = {This paper documents the key issues of performance and compatibility working with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a wireless interface for sensor or controller data and inter-module communication in the context of building interactive digital systems. An overview of BLE MIDI is presented along with a comparison of the protocol from the perspective of theoretical limits and interoperability, showing its widespread compatibility across platforms compared with other alternatives. Then we perform three complementary tests on BLE MIDI and alternative interfaces using prototype and commercial devices, showing that BLE MIDI has comparable performance with the tested WiFi implementations, with end-to-end (sensor input to audio output) latencies of under 10ms under certain conditions. Overall, BLE MIDI is an ideal choice for controllers and sensor interfaces that are designed to work on a wide variety of platforms.}

In this case, the audio-visual content of the movie is selected in real time based on user input to a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Our system supports musical improvisation between human performers and automated systems responding to the BCI. We explore the performers' roles during two performances when these socio-technical systems were implemented, in terms of coordination, problem-solving, managing uncertainty and musical responses to system constraints. This allows us to consider how features of these systems and practices might be incorporated into a general tool, aimed at any musician, which could scale for use in different performance settings involving interactive media. }

  abstract = {Although several Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been presented at NIME, very few of them remain accessible to the community. Rebuilding a DMI is often a necessary step to allow for performance with NIMEs. Rebuilding a DMI exactly similar to its original, however, might not be possible due to technology obsolescence, lack of documentation or other reasons. It might then be interesting to re-interpret a DMI and build an instrument inspired by the original one, creating novel performance opportunities. This paper presents the challenges and approaches involved in rebuilding and re-interpreting an existing DMI, The Sponge by Martin Marier. The rebuilt versions make use of newer/improved technology and customized design aspects like addition of vibrotactile feedback and implementation of different mapping strategies. It also discusses the implications of embedding sound synthesis within the DMI, by using the Prynth framework and further presents a comparison between this approach and the more traditional ground-up approach. As a result of the evaluation and comparison of the two rebuilt DMIs, we present a third version which combines the benefits and discuss performance issues with these devices.}

  abstract = {Libration Perturbed is a performance and an improvisation instrument, originally composed and designed for a multi-speaker dome. The performer controls a bank of 64 virtual inter-connected resonating strings, with individual and direct control of tuning and resonance characteristics through a multitouch-enhanced klavier interface (TouchKeys). It is a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument, as all string vibrations originate from physical vibrations in the klavier and its casing, captured through contact microphones. In addition, there are gestural strings, called ropes, excited by performed musical gestures. All strings and ropes are connected, and inter-resonate together as a ”super-harp”, internally and through the performance space. With strong resonance, strings may go into chaotic motion or emergent quasi-periodic patterns, but custom adaptive leveling mechanisms keep loudness under the musician's control at all times. The hybrid digital/acoustic approach and the enhanced keyboard provide for an expressive and very physical interaction, and a strong multi-channel immersive experience. The paper describes the aesthetic choices behind the design of the system, as well as the technical implementation, and – primarily – the interaction design, as it emerges from mapping, sound design, physical modeling and integration of the acoustic, the gestural, and the virtual. The work is evaluated based on the experiences from a series of performances.}

Specifically, these are instruments that are physical in that they use bodily interaction, take advantage of the physical affordances of the laptop. They are embodied in the sense that instruments are played in such ways where the sound is embedded to be close to the instrument. Three distinct laptop instruments, Taptop, Armtop, and Blowtop, are introduced in this paper. We discuss the integrity of the design process with composing for laptop instruments and performing with them. In this process, our aim is to blur the boundaries of the composer and designer/engineer roles. How the physicality is achieved by leveraging musical gestures gained through traditional instrument practice is studied, as well as those inspired by body gestures. We aim to explore how using such interaction methods affects the communication between the ensemble and the audience. An aesthetic-first qualitative evaluation of these interfaces is discussed, through works and performances crafted specifically for these instruments and presented in the concert setting of the laptop orchestra. In so doing, we reflect on how such physical, embodied instrument design practices can inform a different kind of expressive and performance mindset.}

Then, a gesture recognition system captures gestures that are sent to a sound generator software. The proposed method was used to stage an artistic show in which a Soundpainter had to improvise with 6 different gestures to generate a musical composition from different sounds in real time. The accuracy of the gesture recognition system was evaluated as well as Soundpainter's user experience. In addition, a user evaluation study for using our proposed system in a learning context was also conducted. Current results open up perspectives for the design of new artistic expressions based on the use of automatic gestural recognition supported by Soundpainting language.}

The paper presents three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate the guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which 11 guitarists tested the Magpick for five days and composed a piece with it. Reflecting on their comments and experiences, we outline the innovative features of this technology from the point of view of performance practice. In particular, compared to other augmentations, the high temporal resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the Magpick support a highly nuanced control over the sound. Our discussion highlights the utility of having the locus of augmentation coincide with the locus of interaction.}

The music composer creates beforehand musical elements such as melodic patterns, sound patterns, instruments, group of instruments, and a dynamic score that governs the way the basic elements will behave according to events produced by the audience. During the concert or the performance, the audience, by interacting with the system, gives birth to an original music composition. Skini music scores are expressed in terms of constraints that establish relationships between instruments. A constraint maybe instantaneous, for instance one may disable violins while trumpets are playing. A constraint may also be temporal, for instance, the piano cannot play more than 30 consecutive seconds. The Skini platform is implemented in Hop.js and HipHop.js. HipHop.js, a synchronous reactive DLS, is used for implementing the music scores as its elementary constructs consisting of high level operators such as parallel executions, sequences, awaits, synchronization points, etc, form an ideal core language for implementing Skini constraints. This paper presents the Skini platform. It reports about live performances and an educational project. It briefly overviews the use of HipHop.js for representing score.}

This work aims the elaboration of a strategy in which several gestures performed in a joystick control can influence one or several parameters of the sound synthesis, making a mapping denominated many to many. Buttons combinations used to perform game actions that are common in fighting games, like Street Fighter, were mapped to the synthesizer to create a music. Experiments show that this mapping is capable of influencing the musical expression of a DMI making it closer to an acoustic instrument.}

Several DDMI have already been created, but they have been developed isolatedly, and there is still a lack of a common process of ideation and development. Knowledge about Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) and Interactive Dance Systems (IDSs) can contribute to the design of DDMI, but the former brings few contributions to the body's expressiveness, and the latter brings few references to an instrumental relationship with music. Because of those different premises, the integration between both paradigms can be an arduous task for the designer of DDMI. The conceptual framework of DDMI can also serve as a bridge between DMIs and IDSs, serving as a lingua franca between both communities and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. The conceptual framework has shown to be a promising analytical tool for the design, development, and evaluation of new digital dance and music instrument.}

  abstract = {Physics-based sound synthesis allows to shape the sound by modifying parameters that reference to real world properties of acoustic instruments. This paper presents a hybrid physical modeling single reed instrument, where a virtual tube is coupled to a real mouthpiece with a sensor-equipped clarinet reed. The tube model is provided as an opcode for Csound which is running on the low-latency embedded audio-platform Bela. An actuator is connected to the audio output and the sensor-reed signal is fed back into the input of Bela. The performer can control the coupling between reed and actuator, and is also provided with a 3D-printed slider/knob interface to change parameters of the tube model in real-time.}

John Cage's Water Walk, Carolee Schneeman's Noise Bodies, and David Tudor's Rainforest all lean on both the sonic and cultural affordances of found objects. Today, composers and sound artists continue to look at the everyday, combining readymades with microcontrollers and homemade electronics and repurposing known interfaces for their latent sonic potential. This paper gives a historical overview of work at the intersection of music and the readymade and then describes three recent sound installations/performances by the authors that further explore this space. The emphasis is on processes involved in working with found objects--the complex, practical, and playful explorations into sound and material culture.}

We have recently seen various improvements of interface design on tactile feedback and force guidance aiming to make instrument learning more effective. However, most interfaces are still quite static; they cannot yet sense the learning progress and adjust the tutoring strategy accordingly. To solve this problem, we contribute an adaptive haptic interface based on the latest design of haptic flute. We first adopted a clutch mechanism to enable the interface to turn on and off the haptic control flexibly in real time. The interactive tutor is then able to follow human performances and apply the “teacher force” only when the software instructs so. Finally, we incorporated the adaptive interface with a step-by-step dynamic learning strategy. Experimental results showed that dynamic learning dramatically outperforms static learning, which boosts the learning rate by 45.3% and shrinks the forgetting chance by 86%.}

  abstract = {The Rulers is a Digital Musical Instrument with 7 metal beams, each of which is fixed at one end. It uses infrared sensors, Hall sensors, and strain gauges to estimate deflection. These sensors each perform better or worse depending on the class of gesture the user is making, motivating sensor fusion practices. Residuals between Kalman filters and sensor output are calculated and used as input to a recurrent neural network which outputs a classification that determines which processing parameters and sensor measurements are employed. Multiple instances (30) of layer recurrent neural networks with a single hidden layer varying in size from 1 to 10 processing units were trained, and tested on previously unseen data. The best performing neural network has only 3 hidden units and has a sufficiently low error rate to be good candidate for gesture classification. This paper demonstrates that: dynamic networks out-perform feedforward networks for this type of gesture classification, a small network can handle a problem of this level of complexity, recurrent networks of this size are fast enough for real-time applications of this type, and the importance of training multiple instances of each network architecture and selecting the best performing one from within that set.}

Movement is tracked and mapped through extensive pre-processing to a high-dimensional acoustic space, using a many-to-many mapping, so that every small body movement matters. Designed for improvised exploration, it works as both performance and installation. Through this re-translation of bodily action, position, and posture into infinite-dimensional sound texture and timbre, the performers are invited to re-think and re-learn position and posture as sound, effort as gesture, and timbre as a bodily construction. The sound space can be shared by two people, with added modes of presence, proximity and interaction. The aesthetic background and technical implementation of the system are described, and the system is evaluated based on a number of performances, workshops and installation exhibits. Finally, the aesthetic and choreographic motivations behind the performance narrative are explained, and discussed in the light of the design of the sonification.}

A small scale review covers systems from two prominent UK-based companies, and two itera- tions of a new prototype system that were developed in collaboration with a small group of young people on the autistic spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects of musical experience that are made accessible differ with re- spect to the extent and nature of each system's constraints. It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype system facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques observed during its development. Based on these obser- vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni- ties for the emergence of personal practices and preferences in neurodiverse groups of children and young people, and that this is a fitting subject for further research.}

It works also as a performance instrument that stimulates collaborative remixings from compositions of scored interaction gestures called “scenes”. The interface also aims to be a platform to exchange those sample packs as artistic releases, a format similar to the popular idea of an “album”, but prepared to those four channel packs of samples and scores of interaction. It uses an adaptive audio slicing mechanism and it is based on interaction design for multi-touch screen features. A timing sequencer enhances the interaction between pre-set sequences (the “scenes”) and screen manipulation scratching, expanding and moving graphic sound waves. This paper describes the graphical interface features, some development decisions up to now and perspectives to its continuity.}

These are produced by a neural network that ensures that (with high probability) the melodic and rhythmic structure of the new melody is consistent with a given set of sample songs. We train a Variational Autoencoder network to identify a low-dimensional set of variables that allows for the compression and representation of sample songs. By perturbing these variables with Perlin Noise---a temporally-consistent parameterized noise function---it is possible to generate smoothly-changing novel melodies. We show that (1) by regulating the amount of noise, one can specify how much of the base song will be preserved; and (2) there is a direct correlation between the noise signal and the differences between the statistical properties of novel melodies and the original one. Users can interpret the controllable noise as a type of "creativity knob": the higher it is, the more leeway the network has to generate significantly different melodies. We present a physical prototype that allows musicians to use a keyboard to provide base melodies and to adjust the network's "creativity knobs" to regulate in real-time the process that proposes new melody ideas.}

We created a software framework for this, and designed three interactive sounds and presented them to participants in a workshop based study. We build upon previous work in sound-tracing and mapping-by-demonstration to ask the participants to design gestures with which to perform the given sounds using a multimodal, inertial measurement (IMU) and muscle sensing (EMG) device. We presented the user with four techniques for associating sensor input to synthesizer parameter output. Two were classical techniques from the literature, and two proposed different ways to capture dynamic gesture in a neural network. These four techniques were: 1.) A Static Position regression training procedure, 2.) A Hidden Markov based temporal modeler, 3.) Whole Gesture capture to a neural network, and 4.) a Windowed method using the position-based procedure on the fly during the performance of a dynamic gesture. Our results show trade-offs between accurate, predictable reproduction of the source sounds and exploration of the gesture-sound space. Several of the users were attracted to our new windowed method for capturing gesture anchor points on the fly as training data for neural network based regression. This paper will be of interest to musicians interested in going from sound design to gesture design and offers a workflow for quickly trying different mapping-by-demonstration techniques.}

The piece Vrengt grew from the idea of enabling a true partnership between a musician and a dancer, developing an instrument that would allow for active co-performance. Using a participatory design approach, we worked with sonification as a tool for systematically exploring the dancer's bodily expressions. The exploration used a "spatiotemporal matrix", with a particular focus on sonic microinteraction. In the final performance, two Myo armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the arm and leg of the dancer, together with a wireless headset microphone capturing the sound of breathing. In the paper we reflect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our approach to creating a shared instrument using sonification as a tool for the sound design, and reflect on the performers' subjective evaluation of the instrument.   }

Similarly, the instrument designer, composer, and performer are often the same person. The Academic Festival Overture is a new piece of music for the DMI Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written by a composer who had no prior experience with the instrument. The piece underwent the phases of a composition competition, rehearsals, a music video production, and a public live performance. This whole process was evaluated reflecting on the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the composer, the conductor, and the instrument designer as performer. `Blending dimensions' of these stakeholder and decoupling the composition from the instrument designer inspired the newly involved composer to completely rethink the DMI's interaction and sound concept. Thus, to deliberately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer and a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and at the same time the challenge to seek such a collaboration in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings and improvement.}

The proposed system is based on a natural language processing technique: word-based sequence-to-sequence learning using LSTM units. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that the system is not reliant on a voice-by-voice transcription of drums; instead, in this method, a drum representation is used as an input sequence from which a translated bassline is obtained at the output. The drum representation consists of fixed size sequences of onsets detected from a 2-bar audio drum loop in eight different frequency bands. The basslines generated by this method consist of pitched notes with different duration. The proposed system was trained on two distinct datasets compiled for this project by the authors. Each dataset contains a variety of 2-bar drum loops with annotated basslines from two different styles of dance music: House and Soca. A listening experiment designed based on the system revealed that the proposed system is capable of generating basslines that are interesting and are well rhythmically interlocked with the drum loops from which they were generated.}

  abstract = {This paper presents four years of development in performance and compositional practice on an electronically augmented trumpet called MIGSI. Discussion is focused on conceptual and technical approaches to data mapping, sonic interaction, and composition that are inspired by philosophical questions of time: what is now? Is time linear or multi-directional? Can we operate in multiple modes of temporal perception simultaneously? A number of mapping strategies are presented which explore these ideas through the manipulation of temporal separation between user input and sonic output. In addition to presenting technical progress, this paper will introduce a body of original repertoire composed for MIGSI, in order to illustrate how these tools and approaches have been utilized in live performance and how they may find use in other creative applications.}

It has been informed by nine Colombian migrant women who express their migratory journeys through free body movement, voice and spoken word improvisation. These improvisations have been recorded using Motion Capture, in order to develop interfaces for co-located and telematic interactions for the sharing of narratives of migration. In this paper, using data from the Motion Capture experiments, we are exploring two specific movements from improvisers: displacements on space (walking, rotating), and breathing data. Here we envision how co-relations between walking and breathing, might be further studied to implement interfaces that help the making of connections between place, and the feeling of presence for people in-between distant locations.}

The system is based on a pointing mechanism to interact with a sound scene comprising 128 speakers. Users can point anywhere to interact with the system, and the spatial interaction utilizes motion capture, so it does not require a screen. Instead, it is completely controlled via hand gestures using a glove that is populated with motion-tracking markers.

The main purpose of this system is to offer intuitive physical interaction with the perimeter-based spatial sound sources. Further, its goal is to minimize user-worn technology and thereby enhance freedom of motion by utilizing environmental sensing devices, such as motion capture cameras or infrared sensors. The ensuing creativity enabling technology is applicable to a broad array of possible scenarios, from researching limits of human spatial hearing perception to facilitating learning and artistic performances, including dance. In this paper, we describe our NIME design and implementation, its preliminary assessment, and offer a Unity-based toolkit to facilitate its broader deployment and adoption.}

Instead of aiming for virtuosic perfection of playing the instrument, SlowQin emphasizes the openness for continuously rethinking and reinventing the Guqin's possibilities. Through a combination of conceptual work and practical production, Echo Ho's SlowQin project works as an experimental twist on Historically Informed Performance, with the motivation of conveying artistic gestures that tackle philosophical, ideological, and socio-political subjects embedded in our living environment in globalised conditions.

Rather than predicting symbolic music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future control data from the user and precise temporal information can lead to new and interesting interactive possibilities. We propose that a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predictions can be used to fill-in control data when the user stops performing, or as a kind of filter on the user's own input. We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive musical interaction by recording datasets, training MDRNN models, and experimenting with interaction modes. We illustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying this idea. Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive interaction is viable even on single-board computers and that small models are appropriate for small datasets.}

  abstract = {When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is often of interest to retain an instrument's sound quality and nuanced response while leveraging the richness of digital synthesis.  Digital audio has traditionally been generated through speakers, separating sound generation from the instrument itself, or by adding an actuator within the instrument's resonating body, imparting new sounds along with the original.  We offer a third option, isolating the playing interface from the actuated resonating body, allowing us to rewrite the relationship between performance action and sound result while retaining the general form and feel of the acoustic instrument.  We present a hybrid acoustic-electronic violin based on a stick-body electric violin and an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing individual string displacements.  A conventional violin body acts as the resonator, actuated using digitally altered audio of the string inputs.  By attaching the electric violin above the body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical playing experience of a normal violin along with some of the acoustic filtering and radiation of a traditional build.  We propose the use of the hybrid instrument with digitally automated pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for use as a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.}

Also, players make physical motions and, in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians' artistic intentions. However, it's not clear if the sound manipulation reflects in physical motions. The understanding of the musical structure of the work being performed in its many levels may impact the projection of artistic intentions, and performers alter it in micro and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs, phrases and sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing manipulation and how such variations may reflect in physical gestures. The study involved musicians (flute, clarinet, and bassoon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini. We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the Inter Onsets Interval deviations) and physical motion based on the traveled distance of the flute under different conditions. The flutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in three experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing in duets with previous recordings by other instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. The finding suggests that: 1) the movements, which seem to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent and stable, 2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reflects in gestures' amplitude performed by flutists.}

The actual action-sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and processed in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the acoustical domain alone. The control parameters are captured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm proprieties like filter cutoff frequency, frequency shift or overdrive. The instrument opens up the possibility for a large selection of different interaction techniques that have a direct impact on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a sound designer's perspective, encouraging exploration in the materials used as well as techniques. The contribution are two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer to augment the Sensel Morph affords an extra dimension of control on top of the offerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from physical interactions as a source for excitation and manipulation of an audio processing system offers a large variety of new sounds to be discovered. The methodology involved an exploratory process of iterative instrument making, interspersed with observations gathered via improvisatory trials, focusing on the new interactions made possible through the fusion of audio-rate inputs with the Morph's default interaction methods.}

In addition, this method does not scale to longer samples that require higher-dimensional descriptions, which biases systems towards the use of short samples. In this paper we propose novel framework for automatic creation of interactive sound spaces from sound collections using feature learning and dimensionality reduction. The framework is implemented as a software library using the SuperCollider language. We compare several algorithms and describe some example interfaces for interacting with the resulting spaces. Our experiments signal the potential of unsupervised algorithms for creating data-driven musical interfaces.}

One part of this challenge is the problem of generating convincing accompaniment parts to a given melody, as could be used in an automatic accompaniment system. Despite much progress in this area, systems that can automatically learn to generate interesting sounding, as well as harmonically plausible, accompanying melodies remain somewhat elusive. In this paper we explore the problem of sequence to sequence music generation where a human user provides a sequence of notes, and a neural network model responds with a harmonically suitable sequence of equal length. We consider two sequence-to-sequence models; one featuring standard unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, and the other featuring bidirectional LSTM, both successfully trained to produce a sequence based on the given input. Both of these are fairly dated models, as part of the investigation is to see what can be achieved with such models. These are evaluated and compared via a qualitative study that features 106 respondents listening to eight random samples from our set of generated music, as well as two human samples. From the results we see a preference for the sequences generated by the bidirectional model as well as an indication that these sequences sound more human.}

Individuals interact with the installation by wearing a brainwave interface that measures the strength of the alpha wave signal. The interface then transmits the data to a computer that uses it in order to determine the individual's overall state of relaxation. As the individual achieves higher states of relaxation, mechatronic instruments respond and provide feedback. This feedback not only encourages self-awareness but also it motivates the individual to relax further. Visitors without the headset experience the installation by watching a film and listening to an original musical score. Through the novel arrangement of technologies and features, 'Where Is The Quiet?' demonstrates that mediated technological experiences are capable of evoking meditative states of consciousness, facilitating individual and group connectivity, and deepening awareness of the natural world. As such, this installation opens the door to future research regarding the possibility of immersive experiences supporting humanitarian needs.}

The piece allows a group of people in a relaxed situation to create a piece of ambient music using their smartphones networked through the internet. The players' interactions with the music are derived from the orientations of their phones. The work also has a gameplay aspect; if two players' phones match in orientation, one player has the option to take the other player's note, building up a bank of notes that will be used to form a melody.}

These statements were aggregated, objectified and later reviewed by an expert group consisting of modular synthesizer vendors. Their responses provide the basis for the discussion on how emerging trends in synthesizer interface design reveal challenges and opportunities for the NIME community. }

Longevity is generally regarded as a valuable quality that good design criteria should help to achieve. However, the nature of the tools, of the performance conditions and of the music itself may lead to think of ephemerality as an intrinsic modality of the existence of DMIs. In particular, the conditions of contemporary musical production suggest that contextual adaptations of instrumental devices beyond the monolithic unity of classical instruments should be considered. The first two parts of this article analyse various reasons to reassess the issue of longevity and ephemerality. The last two sections attempt to propose an articulation of these two aspects to inform both the design of the DMI and their learning.}

A fabric soft case fixed to the instrument`s body holds the PICO modules: the touchscreen, the single board computer, the sound card, the speaker system and the DC power bank. The device audio specifications arose from musicological insights about the social role of performers in their musical contexts and the instruments' playing techniques. They were taken as design challenges in the creation process of PICO`s first prototype, which was submitted to a short evaluation. Along with the construction of PICO, we reflected over the design of an interactive audio interface as a mode of research. Therefore, the paper will also discuss methodological aspects of audio hardware design.}

The theoretical reference approached is linked to the embodied cognition, with unfolding related to the cognitive semantics and the enactivist current of cognitive sciences, among other domains of contemporary sciences of mind and neuroscience. The experiments involve the relationship between music and movement, based on prior research using as a reference context in which it is not possible to establish a clear distinction between them: the Capoeira.

Due to their multimodal nature, the analysis or creation of such performances can quickly descend into a house of mirrors wherein certain intensely interdependent dimensions come to the fore, while others are multiplied, seem hidden or are made invisible. In order to have a better understanding of such performances, Dimension Space Analysis, with its capacity to review multifaceted components of a system, can be applied to telematic performances, understood here as (a bundle of) NIMEs. In the second part of the paper, some telematic works from the practices of the authors are described with the toolset developed.}

Chordophone designs have taken multiple forms, from frames that play a guitar-like instrument, to machines that integrate strings and actuators as part of their frame. However, few of these instruments have taken advantage of dynamics, which have been largely unexplored. This paper details the design and construction of a new picking mechanism prototype which enables expressive techniques through fast and precise movement and actuation. We have adopted iterative design and rapid prototyping strategies to develop and refine a compact picker capable of creating dynamic variations reliably. Finally, a quantitative evaluation process demonstrates that this system offers the speed and consistency of previously existing picking mechanisms, while providing increased control over musical dynamics and articulations.}

Our hypothesis is that using evolutionary algorithms with VR for musical interactions will lead to increased user telepresence.

Think aloud trials and thematic analysis revealed 5 main themes: control, comparison to the real world, immersion, general usability and limitations, in addition to practical improvements. Overall, it was found that this combination of technologies did improve telepresence levels, proving the original hypothesis correct.}

Whereas many existing systems present alternatives to the traditional parametric interfaces, the proposed system explores ways in which feature-based synthesis can augment one-to-one parameter control, made possible by fully invertible mappings between control and parameter spaces.}

The results present insights into how a human-machine hybrid system can increase the efficacy of training or exploration, without compromising human engagement with a task.}

  abstract = {Modern computer music performances often involve a musical instrument that is primarily digital; software runs on a computer, and the physical form of the instrument is the computer. In such a practice, the performance interface is rendered on a computer screen for the performer. There has been a concern in using a laptop as a musical instrument from the audience's perspective, in that having ``a laptop performer sitting behind the screen'' makes it difficult for the audience to understand how the performer is creating music.  Mirroring a computer screen on a projection screen has been one way to address the concern and reveal the performer's instrument. This paper introduces and discusses the author's computer music practice, in which a performer actively considers screen mirroring as an essential part of the performance, beyond visualization of music. In this case, screen mirroring is not complementary, but inevitable from the inception of the performance. The related works listed within explore various roles of screen mirroring in computer music performance and helps us understand empirical and logistical findings in such practices.}

Fiber optic cables are separated into bundles and then woven like a basket into a bendable glowing fabric. By equipping light emitting diodes to one side of these bundles and photodiode light intensity sensors to the other, loss of light intensity can be measured when the fabric is bent. The sensing technique of IllumiWear is not only able to discriminate between discreet touch, slight bends, and harsh bends, but also recover the location of deformation. In this way, our computational fabric prototype uses its intrinsic means of visual output (light) as a tool for interactive input. We provide design and implementation details for our prototype as well as a technical evaluation of its effectiveness and limitations as an interactive computational textile. In addition, we examine the potential of this prototype's interactive capabilities by extending our eTextile to create a tangible user interface for audio and visual manipulation.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a new visualization paradigm for graphical interpolation systems, known as Star Interpolation, that has been specifically created for sound design applications. Through the presented investigation of previous visualizations, it becomes apparent that the existing visuals in this class of system, generally relate to the interpolation model that determines the weightings of the presets and not the sonic output. The Star Interpolator looks to resolve this deficiency by providing visual cues that relate to the parameter space. Through comparative exploration it has been found this visualization provides a number of benefits over the previous systems. It is also shown that hybrid visualization can be generated that combined benefits of the new visualization with the existing interpolation models. These can then be accessed by using an Interactive Visualization (IV) approach. The results from our exploration of these visualizations are encouraging and they appear to be advantageous when using the interpolators for sound designs tasks. Therefore, it is proposed that formal usability testing is undertaken to measure the potential value of this form of visualization.}

Performers explore the plate model via tactile interaction through a Sensel Morph interface, chosen to allow damping and localised striking consistent with playing hand percussion.  Through an iteration of prototypes, we have designed an embedded proto-instrument that allows a bodily interaction between the performer and the virtual-acoustic plate in a way that redirects from the perception of the Sensel as a touchpad and reframes it as a percussive surface. Due to the computational effort required to run such a rich physical model and the necessity to provide a natural interaction, the audio processing is implemented on a high powered single board computer. We describe the design challenges and report on the technological solutions we have found in the implementation of Vodhrán which we believe are valuable to the wider NIME community.}

This paper explores the potential of building sound synthesisers with BCIs that are based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). It investigates novel ways to enable patients with motor disabilities to express themselves. It presents a new concept called sonic expression, that is to express oneself purely by the synthesis of sound. It introduces new layouts and designs for BCI-based sound synthesisers and the limitations of these interfaces are discussed. An evaluation of different sound synthesis techniques is conducted to find an appropriate one for such systems. Synthesis techniques are evaluated and compared based on a framework governed by sonic expression.}

The tempo, melody, and timbral features of the generated music are modulated according to biosensor input from each runner using a wearable Bluetooth sensor. We compare the relative performance of athletes listening to heart-rate and cadence synchronous music, across a randomized trial (N=57) on a trail course with 76ft of elevation. Participants were instructed to continue until perceived effort went beyond an 18 using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. We found that cadence-synchronous music improved performance and decreased perceived effort in male runners, and improved performance but not perceived effort in female runners, in comparison to heart-rate synchronous music. This work has implications for the future design and implementation of novel portable music systems and in music-assisted coaching.}

Towards enhanced usability of these descriptor-based frameworks for the music community, the paper advances a minimal content-based audio description scheme, rooted on primary musical notation attributes at the threefold sound object, meso and macro hierarchies. Multiple perceptually-guided viewpoints from rhythmic, harmonic, timbral and dynamic attributes define a discrete and finite alphabet with minimal formal and subjective assumptions using unsupervised and user-guided methods. The Factor Oracle automaton is then adopted to model and visualize temporal morphology. The generative musical applications enabled by the descriptor-based framework at multiple structural hierarchies are discussed.}

In this research, we propose a novel interactive musical instrument called ParaSampling that utilizes the technology of magnetic sound recording, and a improvisational sound playing method based on the instrument. While a conventional cassette tape  player has a single tapehead, which rigidly placed, our instrument utilizes multiple handheld tapehead modules as an interface. Players can hold the interfaces and press them against the rotating magnetic tape at an any point to record or reproduce sounds The player can also easily erase and rewrite the sound recorded on the tape. With this instrument, they can achieve improvised and unique musical expressions through tangible and spatial interactions. In this paper, we describe the system design of ParaSampling, the implementation of the prototype system, and discuss music expressions enabled by the system.}

The idea behind this project was to create an interface which enables the interaction between the performers and the effect processor measuring their brain waves amplitudes, e.g., alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma, not necessarily with the user’s awareness. We achieved this by using an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor for detecting performer’s different emotional states and, based on these, sending midi messages for digital processing units automation. The aim is to create a new generation of digital processor units that could be automatically configured in real-time given the emotions or thoughts of the performer or the audience. By introducing emotional state information in the real time control of several aspects of artistic expression, we highlight the impact of surprise and uniqueness in the artistic performance.}

Describing the close and persistent interactions between organisms of different species, symbioses manifest across a spectrum of relationship types, each identified according to the health effect experienced by the engaged organisms. This biological taxonomy is appropriated within a framework which identifies specific modes of interaction between sound and movement according to the collaborating practitioners’ intended outcome, and required provisions, cognition of affect, and system operation. Using the symbiotic framework as an analytical tool, six dancer-musician collaborations from the field of NIME are examined in respect to the employed modes of interaction within each of the four examined areas. The findings reveal the emergence of multiple modes in each work, as well as examples of mutation between different modes over the course of a performance. Furthermore, the symbiotic concept provides a novel understanding of the ways gesture recognition technologies (GRTs) have redefined the relationship dynamics between dancers and musicians, and suggests a more efficient and inclusive approach in communicating the potential and limitations presented by Human-Computer Interaction tools.}

Olly was tested in the dance studio of a special education needs (SEN) school in North-East London, UK, for a period of 5 weeks, every Thursday afternoon for 30 minutes. Olly uses one Bare touch board in midi mode and four stretch analog sensors embedded inside four elastic ribbons. These ribbons top the main body of the installation which is made by using an inflatable gym ball wrapped in felt. Each of the ribbons plays a different instrument and triggers different harmonic chords. Olly allows to play pleasant melodies if interacting with it in solo mode and more complex harmonies when playing together with others. Results show great potentials for carefully designed musical TUI implementation aimed at scaffolding social play while affording self-regulation in SEN contexts. We present a brief introduction on the background and motivations, design considerations and results.}

Previous research has focused on analysing this new genre from historical, social organisation and technical perspectives. This follow-up paper contributes with reflections on technical and aesthetic aspects of composing within this audience-centric approach. We propose a set of 13 composition dimensions that deal with the role of the performer, the role of the audience, the location of sound and the type of feedback, among others. From a reflective approach, four participatory pieces developed by the authors are analysed using the proposed dimensions. Finally, we discuss a set of recommendations and challenges for the composers-developers of this new and promising musical genre.

Additionally, sensor data from the instruments was recorded and analysed to give a secondary indication of playing style, based on note and silence durations. In accord with previous studies, the high degree of constraints led to a diverse range of playing styles, allowing each player to appropriate and explore the instruments within a short inaugural session. The open, undirected sessions also provided insights which could potentially direct future work based on each person's responses to the instruments. The paper closes with a short discussion of these diverse styles, and the potential role constrained ADMIs could serve as 'ice-breakers' in musical projects that seek to co-produce or co-design with neurodiverse children and young people.}

This paper considers the choices performers make when creating an idiomatic gestural language for an entirely unfamiliar instrument. We designed a musical interface with a unique large-scale layout to encourage new performers to create fully original instrument-body interactions. We conducted a study where trained musicians were invited to perform one of two versions of the same instrument, each physically identical but with a different tone mapping. The study results reveal insights into how musicians develop novel performance gestures when encountering a new instrument characterised by an unfamiliar shape and size. Our discussion highlights the impact of an instrument’s scale and layout on the emergence of new gestural vocabularies and on the qualities of the music performed.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an observational study focusing on the collaborative learning processes of a group of performers with an interactive musical system. The main goal of this study was to implement methods for learning and developing practice with these technological objects in order to generate future pedagogical methods. During the research period of six months, four participants regularly engaged in workshop-type scenarios where learning objectives were proposed and guided by themselves.The principal researcher, working as participant-observer, did not impose or prescribed learning objectives to the other members of the group. Rather, all participants had equal say in what was to be done and how it was to be accomplished. Results show that the group learning environment is rich in opportunities for learning, mutual teaching, and for establishing a comunal practice for a given interactive musical system.Key findings suggest that learning by demonstration, observation and modelling are significant for learning in this context. Additionally, it was observed that a dialogue and a continuous flow of information between the members of the community is needed in order to motivate and further their learning.}

Each catalogue entry is annotated according to a proposed taxonomy for DMIs for education, rooted in the mechanics of control, mapping and feedback of an interactive music system, along with the required expertise of target user groups and the instrument learning curve. Global statistics unpack underlying trends and design goals across the chronological period of the NIME conference. In recent years, we note a growing number of DMIs targeting non-experts and with reduced requirements in terms of expertise. Stemming from the identified trends, we discuss future challenges in the design of DMIs for education towards enhanced degrees of variation and unpredictability.}

  abstract = {The tabla is a traditional pitched two-piece Indian drum set, popular not only within South East Asian music, but whose sounds also regularly feature in western music. Yet tabla remains an aural tradition, taught largely through a guru system heavy in custom and mystique. Tablas can also pose problems for school and professional performance environments as they are physically bulky, fragile, and reactive to environmental factors such as damp and heat. As part of a broader project to demystify tabla, we present an electronic tabla that plays nearly identically to an acoustic tabla and was created in order to make the tabla acces- sible and practical for a wider audience of students, pro- fessional musicians and composers. Along with develop- ment of standardised tabla notation and instructional educational aides, the electronic tabla is designed to be compact, robust, easily tuned, and the electronic nature allows for scoring tabla through playing. Further, used as an interface, it allows the use of learned tabla technique to control other percussive sounds. We also discuss the technological approaches used to accurately capture the localized multi-touch rapid-fire strikes and damping that combine to make tabla such a captivating and virtuosic instrument.}

The instrument features a breath pressure sensor with a large dynamic range, a keyboard that allows for polyphonic pitch selection, and a completely integrated construction. Sound synthesis is performed with Faust code compiled to the Bela Mini, which offers low-latency audio and a simple yet powerful development workflow. In order to be as accessible and versatile as possible, the hardware and software is entirely open-source, and fabrication requires only common maker tools.}

Despite an abundance of techniques and systems little research has explored how these might be useful for end-users looking to compose with generative and algorithmic music techniques. User interfaces for generative music systems are often inaccessible to non-programmers and neglect established composition workflow and design paradigms that are familiar to computer-based music composers. We have developed a system called the Interactive Generative Music Environment (IGME) that attempts to bridge the gap between generative music and music sequencing software, through an easy to use score editing interface. This paper discusses a series of user studies in which users explore generative music composition with IGME. A questionnaire evaluates the user’s perception of interacting with generative music and from this provide recommendations for future generative music systems and interfaces.}

The user interface prevailing in the world of synthesizers and music controllers has always been revolving around knobs, faders, switches, dials, buttons, or capacitive touchpads, to name a few. This paper presents a novel way of interaction with a modular synthesizer by exploring the affordances of cord-base UIs. A special patch cable was developed us- ing commercially available piezo-resistive rubber cords, and was adapted to fit to the 3.5 mm mono audio jack, making it compatible with the Eurorack modular-synth standard. Moreover, a module was developed to condition this stretch- able sensor/cable, to allow multiple Patch-cordes to be used in a given patch simultaneously. This paper also presents a vocabulary of interactions, labeled through various physical actions, turning the patch cable into an expressive controller that complements traditional patching techniques.}

This paper is dedicated to the sound installation “Soil choir v.1.3” that sonifies soil moisture in different depths and transforms this non-musical phenomenon into organized sound structures. The sonification of natural soil moisture processes tests the limits of our attention, patience and willingness to still perceive ultra-slow reactions and examines the mechanisms of our sense adaptation. Although the musical time of the installation is set to almost non-human – environmental time scale (changes happen within hours, days, weeks or even months…) this system can be explored and even played also as an instrument by putting sensors to different soil areas or pouring liquid into the soil and waiting for changes... The crucial aspect of the work was to design the sonification architecture that deals with extreme slow changes of input data – measured values from moisture sensors. The result is the sound installation consisting of three objects – each with different types of soil. Every object is compact, independent unit consisting of three low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensors, 1m long perspex tube filled with soil, full range loudspeaker and Bela platform with custom Supercollider code. I developed this installation during the year 2019 and this paper gives insight into the aspects and issues connected with creating this installation.}

The instruments are made intentionally rough-hewn, non-optimal and user-unfriendly in several respects, and are shown to draw upon experimental traits in electronics de- sign and interfaces for music expression. The various different ways in which such design traits affects their performance are outlined, as are their overall consequence to the artistic outcome and to individual experiences of it. It is shown that, to a varying extent, they all embody, mediate, and aid actualise the specifics their parent projects revolve around. It is eventually suggested that in the context of an exploratory and hybrid artistic practice, bespoke instruments of sorts, their improvised performance, the material traits or processes they implement or pivot on, and the ideas/narratives that perturb thereof, may all intertwine and fuse into one another so that a clear distinction between one another is not always possible, or meaningful. In such a vein, this paper aims at being an account of such a practice upon which prospective researchers/artists may further build upon.}

Today,  however,  there  is  a  lack  of  improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not trained to improvise, or cannot find other people to improvise with.  Motivated by this observation,  we  develop BachDuet,  a  system  that  enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human anda machine.  This system uses a recurrent neural network toprocess the human musician’s monophonic performance ona MIDI keyboard and generates the machine’s monophonic performance in real time. We  develop a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction. We  conduct  user  studies  with  13  musically  trained users  and  show  the  feasibility  of  two-party  duet  counterpoint improvisation and the effectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose.  We also conduct listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the difference between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those generated by human-human improvisation.  Objective evaluation is also conducted to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint, showing promising results.}

For the same reason however, they may hinder the audience experience, making the musician contribution and expressiveness difficult to perceive. In order to cope with this issue without altering the instruments, researchers and artists alike have designed techniques to augment their performances with additional information, through audio, haptic or visual modalities. These techniques have however only been designed to offer a fixed level of information, without taking into account the variety of spectators expertise and preferences. In this paper, we investigate the design, implementation and effect on audience experience of visual augmentations with controllable level of detail (LOD). We conduct a controlled experiment with 18 participants, including novices and experts. Our results show contrasts in the impact of LOD on experience and comprehension for experts and novices, and highlight the diversity of usage of visual augmentations by spectators.}

The results show that a maximum message rate of 2300 Hz is possible on a 2.4 GHz network for a single embedded device and decreases as the number of devices are added. During testing it was possible to have up to 7 devices transmitting at 100 Hz while attaining less than 10 ms latency, but performance degrades with increasing sending rates and number of devices. Performance can also vary significantly from day to day depending on network usage in a crowded environment.}

In  the  case of heterogeneous digital orchestras, where the instruments, interfaces, and control gestures can be very different, a number of issues may impede such collaboration opportunities. These include the  lack  of  a  standard  method  for  sharing data or control, the incompatibility of parameter types, and limited  awareness  of  other  musicians’  activity  and  instrument  structure.   As  a  result,  most  collaborations  remain limited to synchronising tempo or applying effects to audio outputs. In this paper we present two interfaces for real-time group collaboration amongst musicians with heterogeneous instruments.   We  conducted  a  qualitative  study  to  investigate how these interfaces impact musicians’ experience and their musical output, we performed a thematic analysis of inter-views,  and  we  analysed  logs  of  interactions.   From  these results  we  derive  principles  and  guidelines  for  the  design of advanced collaboration systems for heterogeneous digital orchestras, namely Adapting  (to)  the  System, Support  Development, Default  to  Openness, and Minimise  Friction to Support Expressivity.}

SonicDive is an interactive installation that enables users to explore a complex water soundscape through their movement inside a ball pool. The underlying goal of both ADMIs was the promotion of self-efficacy experiences while stimulating the users' relaxation and activation.

Because of this any assigned and registered target tracking points for specific users are lost, as are the linked abilities of that performer to control media based on their movements. We describe a single camera system for overcoming this problem by assigning IDs based on the colours worn by the performers, and then using the colour tracking for updating and confirming identification when the performer reappears after occlusion or upon re-entry. A video link is supplied showing the system used for an interactive dance work with four dancers controlling individual audio tracks. }

  abstract = {In this study, an analog synthesizer module using Aloe vera was proposed as a biomemristor. The recent revival of analog modular synthesizers explores novel possibilities of sounds based on unconventional technologies such as integrating biological forms and structures into traditional circuits. A biosignal has been used in experimental music as the material for composition. However, the recent development of a biocomputor using a slime mold biomemristor expands the use of biomemristors in music. Based on prior research, characteristics of Aloe vera as a biomemristor were electrically measured, and two types of analog synthesizer modules were developed, current to voltage converter and current spike to voltage converter. For this application, a live performance was conducted with the CVC module and the possibilities as a new interface for musical expression were examined.}

  abstract = {On several acoustic and electromechanical keyboard instruments, the produced sound is not always strictly dependent exclusively on a discrete key velocity parameter, and minute gesture details can affect the final sonic result. By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.}

  abstract = {In NIME design, thorough attention has been devoted to feedback modalities, including auditory, visual and haptic feedback. How the performer executes the gestures to achieve a sound on an instrument, by contrast, appears to be less examined. Previous research showed that auditory imagery, or the ability to hear or recreate sounds in the mind even when no audible sound is present, is essential to the sensorimotor control involved in playing an instrument. In this paper, we enquire whether auditory imagery can also help to support skill transfer between musical instruments resulting in possible implications for new instrument design. To answer this question, we performed two experimental studies on pitch accuracy and fluency where professional violinists were asked to play a modified violin. Results showed altered or even possibly irrelevant auditory feedback on a modified violin does not appear to be a significant impediment to performance. However, performers need to have coherent imagery of what they want to do, and the sonic outcome needs to be coupled to the motor program to achieve it. This finding shows that the design lens should be shifted from a direct feedback model of instrumental playing toward a model where imagery guides the playing process. This result is in agreement with recent research on skilled sensorimotor control that highlights the value of feedforward anticipation in embodied musical performance. It is also of primary importance for the design of new instruments: new sounds that cannot easily be imagined and that are not coupled to a motor program are not likely to be easily performed on the instrument.}

This idea builds upon the notion of graphic scores and composed instrument, and apply them in a new context. Our proposal also explores possible parallels between open meaning in interaction design, and aleatoric score, conceptualized as Open Work by the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco. Our approach has two aims. The first aim is to create an environment where users can immerse themselves in the visual elements of a score while listening to the corresponding music. The second aim is to facilitate users to develop a personal relationship with both the system and the score. To achieve those aims, as a practical implementation of our proposed concept, we developed two immersive scenarios: a 360º video and an interactive space. We conclude presenting how our design aims were accomplished in the two scenarios, and describing positive and negative elements of our implementations.}

The textile quality of the fine steel wire-mesh evokes a haptic familiarity inherent to textile materials.  This makes it easy for the audience to overcome the initial threshold barrier to get in touch with the artwork in an exhibition situation. Additionally, the interaction is not dependent on visuals. The characteristics of the surface sensor allows a user to play the instrument without actually touching it.}

In an objective test of dynamic range, we find that our implementation provides wider and more consistent dynamic range response in comparison with solenoid-based robotic percussionists.

A playful pedagogical approach based on practice-based methods is presented and evaluated. My goal was introducing the art of NIME design and performance giving less emphasis to technology. Instead of letting technology determine how we teach and think during the class, I propose fostering at first the student's active construction and understanding of the field experimenting with physical materials,sound production and bodily movements. For this intention I developed a few classroom exercises which my students had to study and practice. During this period of five years, 95 students attended the course. At the end of the semester course, each student designed, built and performed a new interface for musical expression in front of an audience. Thus, in this paper I describe and discuss the benefits of applying playfulness and practice-based methods for teaching NIME in art universities. I introduce the methods and classroom exercises developed and finally I present some lessons learned from this pedagogical experience.}

We present a brief history at the intersection of VR and the laptop orchestra. We then present the design of the piece and distill it into a set of design principles. Broadly, these design principles address the interplay between the different conflicting perspectives at play: those of the VR performer, the ensemble, and the audience. For example, one principle suggests that the perceptual link between the physical and virtual world maybe enhanced for the audience by improving the performers' sense of embodiment. We argue that these design principles are a form of generalized knowledge about how we might design laptop orchestra pieces involving virtual reality.}

Failing to do so would result in an unintentional but tacit acceptance and support of such ideologies. We explore one item to be included in this political agenda: the recent trend in music technology of ``democratising music'', which carries implicit political ideologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with a number of recommendations for stimulating community-wide discussion on these themes in the hope that this leads to the development of an outward-facing perspective that fully engages with political topics.}

The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament which produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. While these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, and performative applications of the instrument.}

In this paper, we present the P(l)aying Attention framework for manipulating recorded music to support these people, and to help the therapists that work with them. The aim is to facilitate body awareness, exploration, and expressivity by allowing the manipulation of a pre-recorded ‘ensemble’ through an interpretation of body movement, provided by a machine-learning system trained on physiotherapist assessments and movement data from people with chronic pain.  The system considers the nature of a person’s movement (e.g. protective) and offers an interpretation in terms of the joint-groups that are playing a major role in the determination at that point in the movement, and to which attention should perhaps be given (or the opposite at the user’s discretion).  Using music to convey the interpretation offers informational (through movement sonification) and creative (through manipulating the ensemble by movement) possibilities.  The approach offers the opportunity to explore movement and music at multiple timescales and under varying musical aesthetics.}

  abstract = {We present a musical interface specifically designed for inclusive performance that offers a shared experience for both individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing as well as those who are not. This interface borrows gestures (with or without overt meaning) from American Sign Language (ASL), rendered using low-frequency sounds that can be felt by everyone in the performance. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing cannot experience the sound in the same way. Instead, they are able to physically experience the vibrations, nuances, contours, as well as its correspondence with the hand gestures. Those who are not hard of hearing can experience the sound, but also feel it just the same, with the knowledge that the same physical vibrations are shared by everyone. The employment of sign language adds another aesthetic dimension to the instrument --a nuanced borrowing of a functional communication medium for an artistic end.  }

Examples of previous work in the literature that use audio as sensor input data are examined for insights into how the use of Sound Sensors provides unique opportunities within the NIME context.  We present the results of a user study comparing sound-based sensors to other sensing modalities within the context of controlling parameters.  The study suggests that the use of Sound Sensors can enhance gestural flexibility and nuance  but that they also present challenges in accuracy and repeatability.}

They are then used for interactively generating audio-visual effects that match each of the movements. We developed a digital content that integrated these functionalities and enabled composition and live performance through manipulation of spheroids.}

In order to get an overview of existing and desired usages, we launched an on-line survey that collected 37 answers from practicioners in and outside of academic and design communities. In the survey we inquired about the participants' devices, their strengths and weaknesses, the layout of control dimensions, the used gestures and mappings, the synthesis software or hardware and the use of audio descriptors and machine learning. The results can inform the design of future interfaces, gesture analysis and mapping, and give directions for the need and use of machine learning for user adaptation.}

  abstract = {General-Purpose GPU computing is becoming an increasingly viable option for acceleration, including in the audio domain. Although it can improve performance, the intrinsic nature of a device like the GPU involves data transfers and execution commands which requires time to complete. Therefore, there is an understandable caution concerning the overhead involved with using the GPU for audio computation. This paper aims to clarify the limitations by presenting a performance benchmarking suite. The benchmarks utilize OpenCL and CUDA across various tests to highlight the considerations and limitations of processing audio in the GPU environment. The benchmarking suite has been used to gather a collection of results across various hardware. Salient results have been reviewed in order to highlight the benefits and limitations of the GPU for digital audio. The results in this work show that the minimal GPU overhead fits into the real-time audio requirements provided the buffer size is selected carefully. The baseline overhead is shown to be roughly 0.1ms, depending on the GPU. This means buffer sizes 8 and above are completed within the allocated time frame. Results from more demanding tests, involving physical modelling synthesis, demonstrated a balance was needed between meeting the sample rate and keeping within limits for latency and jitter. Buffer sizes from 1 to 16 failed to sustain the sample rate whilst buffer sizes 512 to 32768 exceeded either latency or jitter limits. Buffer sizes in between these ranges, such as 256, satisfied the sample rate, latency and jitter requirements chosen for this paper.}

We will give technical details of the Ambulation system we developed as part of the creation of the piece, and conclude with a collection of observations that emerged from the project. The research around the development and presentation of Ambulation contributes to the idea of field recording as a live, procedural practice, moving away from the ideas of the movement of documentary material from one place to another.

However, most current systems are still designed to master individual pieces of music; it is unclear how well the learned skills can be generalized to new pieces. We aim to explore this question. In this study, we contribute Interactive Rainbow Score, an interactive visual system to boost the learning of sight-playing, the general musical skill to read music and map the visual representations to performance motions. The key design of Interactive Rainbow Score is to associate pitches (and the corresponding motions) with colored notation and further strengthen such association via real-time interactions. Quantitative results show that the interactive feature on average increases the learning efficiency by 31.1%. Further analysis indicates that it is critical to apply the interaction in the early period of learning.}

We therefore propose a set of relevant dimensions, which are based both on categories proposed in recent works in the research context, and on original contributions. We then proceed to demonstrate its applicability by selecting a set of relevant case studies, and analyzing a sample set of ADMIs found in the literature.}

The second is based on interpolation between presets represented by polygons on screen and is called holistic. Participants had to listen to, memorize, and search for sound presets characterized by four parameters. Ten different configurations of sound synthesis and processing were presented to each participant, once for each approach. The performance scores of 28 participants (not including early testers) were computed using two measured values: the search duration, and the parametric distance between the reference and answered presets. Compared to the analytic sliders-based interface, the holistic interpolation-based interface demonstrated a significant performance improvement for 60% of sound synthesizers. The other 40% led to equivalent results for the analytic and holistic interfaces. Using sliders, expert users performed nearly as well as they did with interpolation. Beginners and intermediate users struggled more with sliders, while the interpolation allowed them to get quite close to experts’ results.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this project is to develop an interface for writing and performing music using sequencers in virtual reality (VR). The VR sequencer deals with chance-based operations to select audio clips for playback and spatial orientation-based rhythm and melody generation, while incorporating three-dimensional (3-D) objects as omnidirectional playheads. Spheres which grow from a variable minimum size to a variable maximum size at a variable speed, constantly looping, represent the passage of time in this VR sequencer. The 3-D assets which represent samples are actually sample containers that come in six common dice shapes. As the dice come into contact with a sphere, their samples are triggered to play. This behavior mimics digital audio workstation (DAW) playheads reading MIDI left-to-right in popular professional and consumer software sequencers. To incorporate height into VR music making, the VR sequencer is capable of generating terrain at the press of a button. Each terrain will gradually change, creating the possibility for the dice to roll on their own. Audio effects are built in to each scene and mapped to terrain parameters, creating another opportunity for chance operations in the music making process. The chance-based sample selection, spatial orientation-defined rhythms, and variable terrain mapped to audio effects lead to indeterminacy in performance and replication of a single piece of music. This project aims to give the gaming community access to experimental music making by means of consumer virtual reality hardware.}

Using Sonami’s current practice as a case study, this paper explores the utility, opportunities, and challenges involved in using ML in practice over many years. This paper also reports the perspective of Rebecca Fiebrink, the creator of the Wekinator ML tool used by Sonami, revealing how her work with Sonami has led to changes to the software and to her teaching. This paper thus contributes a deeper understanding of the value of ML for NIME practitioners, and it can inform design considerations for future ML toolkits as well as NIME pedagogy. Further, it provides new perspectives on familiar NIME conversations about mapping strategies, expressivity, and control, informed by a dedicated practice over many years.}

The sonic layer forms a link between the two, as a three-dimensional sound composition. Connections in the system allow for multiple streams of data to run between the layers, which are used for the real-time modulation of parameters.

The approach presented uses realtime machine vision applied to a live video feed of a scene, from which detected objects and people are fed into Manhattan (Nash, 2014), a digital music notation that integrates sequencing and programming to support the live creation of complex musical works that combine static, algorithmic, and interactive elements. The paper discusses the technical details of the system and artistic development of specific musical works, introducing novel techniques for mapping chaotic systems to musical expression and exploring issues of agency, aesthetic, accessibility and adaptability relating to composing interactive music for crowds and public spaces. In particular, performances as part of an installation for BBC Music Day 2018 are described. The paper subsequently details a practical workshop, delivered digitally, exploring the development of interactive performances in which the audience or general public actively or passively control live generation of a musical piece. Exercises support discussions on technical, aesthetic, and ontological issues arising from the identification and mapping of structure, order, and meaning in non-musical domains to analogous concepts in musical expression. Materials for the workshop are available freely with the Manhattan software.}

The synthesizer was evaluated with a user study. Participants listened to music generated by the synthesizer, and described the music with words. The arousal of the words they entered was highly correlated with the intended arousal of the music. The same was, surprisingly, not true for valence. The synthesizer is online, at [redacted URL].}

First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.}

  abstract = {TorqueTuner is an embedded module that allows Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) designers to map sensors to parameters of haptic effects and dynamically modify rotary force feedback in real-time. We embedded inside TorqueTuner a collection of haptic effects (Wall, Magnet, Detents, Spring, Friction, Spin, Free) and a bi-directional interface through libmapper, a software library for making connections between data signals on a shared network. To increase affordability and portability of force-feedback implementations in DMI design, we designed our platform to be wireless, self-contained and built from commercially available components. To provide examples of modularity and portability, we integrated TorqueTuner into a standalone haptic knob and into an existing DMI, the T-Stick. We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider. While the original goal was to simulate the haptic feedback associated with turning a knob, we found that the platform allows for further expanding interaction possibilities in application scenarios where rotary control is familiar.}

Building upon successful educational technologies that intersect both music and computer programming, Codetta seeks to enable child composition, whilst aiding generalist educator’s confidence in teaching music.}

However, one of the greatest challenges in mechatronic music is to enable these robots to deliver a nuanced and expressive performance. This depends on their capability to integrate dynamics, articulation, and a variety of ornamental techniques while playing a given musical passage. In this paper we introduce a robot arm pitch shifter for a mechatronic monochord prototype. This is a fast, precise, and mechanically quiet system that enables sliding techniques during musical performance. We discuss the design and construction process, as well as the system's advantages and restrictions. We also review the quantitative evaluation process used to assess if the instrument meets the design requirements. This process reveals how the pitch shifter outperforms existing configurations, and potential areas of improvement for future work.}

The AirSticks, although fully-functioning, were used as props in live performances in order to evaluate potential mapping strategies that were later implemented for real. This use of mime when designing Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) can help overcome choice paralysis, break from established habits, and liberate creators to realise more meaningful parameter mappings. Bringing this process into an interactive performance environment acknowledges the audience as stakeholders in the design of these instruments, and also leads us to reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions made by an audience when engaging with the performance of such ‘magical’ devices. This paper establishes two opposing strategies to parameter mapping, ‘movement-first’ mapping, and the less conventional ‘sound-first’ mapping that incorporates mime. We discuss the performance ‘One Five Nine’, its transformation from a partial mime into a fully interactive presentation, and the influence this process has had on the outcome of the performance and the AirSticks as a whole.}

In alternative cross-modal solutions, a compromise is likely made in either the sonic or visual output, or the consistency and intuitiveness of the composition environment. By integrating control mechanisms for graphics inside VCV Rack, the music-making metaphors used to build a patch are extended into the visual domain. Users familiar with modular synthesizers are immediately able to start building high-fidelity graphics using the same control voltages regularly used to compose sound. Without needing to interact with two separate development environments, languages or metaphorical domains, users are encouraged to freely, creatively and enjoyably construct their own highly-integrated audio-visual instruments. This demonstration will showcase the construction of an audio-visual patch using URack, focusing on the integration of flexible GPU particle systems present in Unity with the vast library of creative audio composition modules inside VCV.}

Subsequently, we present the design and development of the Sounding Brush application.

Drawing is essentially the act of playing music by means of a continuous process of observation, individualisation and exploring time and space in a unique way.}

The particular deep learning model we use for this instrument was trained with existing data set as input for purposes of further experimentation. The main benefits of the model used are the ability to produce the realistic range of timbre of the trained data set and the ability to generate new audio samples in real-time, in the moment of playing, with the characteristics of sounds that the performer ever heard before.   We argue that these advanced intelligence features on the audio synthesis level could allow us to explore performing music with particular response features that define the instrument's digital idiomaticity and allow us reinvent the instrument in the act of music performance.}

  abstract = {Feedback instruments offer radical new ways of engaging with instrument design and musicianship. They are defined by recurrent circulation of signals through the instrument, which give the instrument ‘a life of its own’ and a 'stimulating uncontrollability'.  Arguably, the most interesting musical behaviour in these instruments happens when their dynamic complexity is maximised, without falling into saturating feedback. It is often challenging to keep the instrument in this zone; this research looks at algorithmic ways to manage the behaviour of feedback loops in order to make feedback instruments more playable and musical; to expand and maintain the `sweet spot'. We propose a solution that manages gain dynamics based on measurement of complexity, using a realtime implementation of the Effort to Compress algorithm. The system was evaluated with four musicians, each of whom have different variations of string-based feedback instruments, following an autobiographical design approach.  Qualitative feedback was gathered, showing that the system was successful in modifying the behaviour of these instruments to allow easier access to edge transition zones, sometimes at the expense of losing some of the more compelling dynamics of the instruments. The basic efficacy of the system is evidenced by descriptive audio analysis. This paper is accompanied by a dataset of sounds collected during the study, and the open source software that was written to support the research.}

The mapping between neurophysiological cues and audio parameter must be intuitive for a neophyte audience (i.e., one without prior training or the physical skills developed by professional audio engineers when working with tactile interfaces). The prototype is dubbed MINDMIX (a portmanteau of ‘mind’ and ‘mixer’), combining discrete and many-to-many mappings of audio mixer parameters and BCI control signals measured via Electronecephalograph (EEG).

An elastic rubber membrane forms the playing surface of the instrument, while machine learning is used for dimensionality reduction and gesture recognition. The membrane is stretched over a hollow shell which permits considerable depth excursion, with an array of distance sensors tracking the surface displacement from underneath. The inherent dynamics of the membrane lead to cross-coupling between nearby sensors, however we do not see this as a flaw or limitation. Instead we find this coupling gives structure to the playing techniques and mapping schemes chosen by the user. The instrument is best utilized as a tool for actively designing abstraction and forming a relative control structure within a given system, one which allows for intuitive gestural control beyond what can be accomplished with conventional musical controllers.}

Differences were found in primary target user groups of digital platforms in the UK and China as well as the stages of the culture creation cycle they were developed for. Reasons for the divergence of digital platforms include differences in culture, regulation, and infrastructure, as well as the inherent Western bias of software for music making such as Digital Audio Workstations. Using AI to bridge between Western and Chinese music traditions is suggested as an opportunity to address aspects of the divergent landscape of digital platforms for music inside and outside China.}

  abstract = {Digitally integrating the materiality, form, and tactility in everyday objects (e.g., pottery) provides inspiration for new ways of musical expression and performance. In this project we reinterpret the creative process and aesthetic philosophy of pottery as algorithmic music to help users rediscover the latent story behind pottery through a synesthetic experience. Projects Mobius I and Mobius II illustrate two potential directions toward a musical interface, one focusing on the circular form, and the other, on graphical ornaments of pottery. Six conductive graphics on the pottery function as capacitive sensors while retaining their resemblance to traditional ornamental patterns in pottery. Offering pottery as a musical interface, we invite users to orchestrate algorithmic music by physically touching the different graphics.}

We argue that this principle can provide more intuitive user experiences when the interface does not provide direct haptic feedback – such as interfaces made with various gesture-tracking technologies. Grounded in five concepts from the theoretical literature on force dynamics in musical cognition, the paper presents a set of principles for interaction design focused on five force schemas: Path restraint, Containment restraint, Counter-force, Attraction, and Compulsion. We describe an initial set of examples that implement these principles using a Leap Motion sensor for gesture tracking and SuperCollider for interactive audio design. Finally, the paper presents a pilot experiment that provides initial ratings of intuitiveness in the user experience.}

In this paper, creative uses of time as a parameter in continuous controller mapping are demonstrated: the speed of movement affects the position mapping and control output. A set of SuperCollider classes are presented, developed in the author’s practice in computer music, where they have been used together with commercial MIDI controllers. The creative applications employ various approaches and metaphors for scaling time, but also machine learning for recognising patterns. In the techniques, performer, controller and synthesis ‘intra-act’, to use Karen Barad’s term: because position and velocity are derived from the same data, sound output cannot be predicted without the temporal context of performance.}

For this purpose, a conceptual framework and a multilayered mapping model issued from an experimental case study will be proposed. The goal of this research is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to determine action-based perceptual invariants that allow us to establish pertinent relations between gesture qualities and sound features. On the other hand, we are interested in analysing how an interactive model-based sonification can provide useful and effective feedback for dance practitioners. From this point of view, our research explicitly addresses the convergence between the scientific understandings provided by the field of movement sonification and the traditional know-how developed over the years within the digital instrument and interaction design communities. A key component of our study is the combination between physically-based sound synthesis and motion features analysis. This approach has proven effective in providing interesting insights for devising novel sonification models for artistic and scientific purposes, and for developing a collaborative platform involving the designer, the musician and the performer.}

We hypothesized that a music beginner cannot determine tonal pitches of melody over a particular chord but can use body movements to specify the pitch contour (i.e., melodic outline) and the attack timings (i.e., rhythm). We aim to realize a performance interface for supporting expressing intuitive pitch contour and attack timings using body motion and outputting harmonious pitches over the chord progression of the background music. Since the intended users of this system are not limited to people with music experience, we plan to develop a system that uses Android smartphones, which many people have. Our system consists of three modules: a module for specifying attack timing using smartphone sensors, module for estimating the vertical movement of the smartphone using smartphone sensors, and module for estimating the sound height using smartphone vertical movement and background chord progression. Each estimation module is developed using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is often used to estimate time series data. We conduct evaluation experiments for each module. As a result, the attack timing estimation had zero misjudgments, and the mean error time of the estimated attack timing was smaller than the sensor-acquisition interval. The accuracy of the vertical motion estimation was 64%, and that of the pitch estimation was 7.6%. The results indicate that the attack timing is accurate enough, but the vertical motion estimation and the pitch estimation need to be improved for actual use.}

  abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.}

In this work, we take advantage of the HoloLens' spatial awareness to build sonic spaces that have a precise spatial relationship to a given sculpture and where the sculpture itself is modelled in the augmented scene as an "invisible hologram". We describe the artistic rationale for our artwork, the design of the two interaction schemes, and the technical and usability feedback that we have obtained from demonstrations during iterative development.

The possibility to use sensors for providing an input for sound processing/synthesis units let composers and sound artist open up new ways for experimentation. Augmented Reality, by rendering virtual objects in the real world and by making those objects interactive (via some sensor-generated input), provides a new frame for this research field. In fact, the 3D visual feedback, delivering a precise indication of the spatial configuration/function of each virtual interface, can make the instrumental augmentation process more intuitive for the interpreter and more resourceful for a composer/creator: interfaces can change their behavior over time, can be reshaped, activated or deactivated. Each of these modifications can be made obvious to the performer by using strategies of visual feedback. In addition, it is possible to accurately sample space and to map it with differentiated functions. Augmenting interfaces can also be considered a visual expressive tool for the audience and designed accordingly: the performer’s point of view (or another point of view provided by an external camera) can be mirrored to a projector. This article will show some example of different designs of AR piano augmentation from the composition Studi sulla realtà nuova.}

This paper embodies the more recent acknowledgement of the importance of practice-based methods of evaluation [1,2,3,4] concerning the use of NIMEs within performance and the recognition that it is only within the situation of practice that the context is available to actually interpret and evaluate the instrument [2]. Within this context this paper revisits the Feral Cello performance system that was first presented at NIME 2017 [5]. This paper explores what has been learned through the artistic practice of performing and workshopping in this context by drawing heavily on the experiences of the performer/composer who has become an integral part of this project and co-author of this paper. The original philosophical context is also revisited and reflections are made on the tensions between this position and the need to ‘get something to work’. The authors feel the presentation of the semi-structured interview within the paper is the best method of staying truthful to Hayes understanding of musical improvisation as an enactive framework ‘in its ability to demonstrate the importance of participatory, relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and processes’ [4].}

In particular, in jazz improvisation, one of the major barriers is the mastery and appropriate selection of scales from a wide range, according to harmonic context and style. In this paper, we present AutoScale, an interactive software for making jazz improvisation more accessible by lifting the burden of scale selection from the musician while still allowing full controllability if desired. This is realized by implementing a MIDI effect that dynamically maps the desired scales onto a standardized layout. Scale selection can be pre-programmed, automated based on algorithmic lead sheet analysis, or interactively adapted. We discuss the music-theoretical foundations underlying our approach, the design choices taken for building an intuitive user interface, and provide implementations as VST plugin and web applications for use with a Launchpad or traditional MIDI keyboard.}

In this paper we highlight many of the recent—and some not so recent—challenges that have been brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of the neoliberal university—which have underpinned academia's drive for innovation—and the quantification and economisation of research performance which have facilitated certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies, we suggest that critical reflection and moreover mediation is necessary in order to address burgeoning concerns which have been raised within the NIME discourse in relation to methodological approaches,'diversity and inclusion', 'accessibility', and the fostering of rigorous interdisciplinary research.}

The real-time music programming languages powering many new instruments often provide access to audio manipulation at a low level, theoretically allowing the creation of any sonic structure from primitive operations. As a result, designers may assume that these seemingly omnipotent tools are pliable vehicles for the expression of musical ideas. We present the outcomes of a compositional game in which sound designers were invited to create simple instruments using common sensors and the Pure Data programming language. We report on the patterns and structures that often emerged during the exercise, arguing that designers respond strongly to suggestions offered by the tools they use. We discuss the idea that current music programming languages may be as culturally loaded as the communities of practice that produce and use them. Instrument making is then best viewed as a protracted negotiation between designer and tools.}

Its foundations lie in the use of the guitar's body for percussive lines, and in the extended range given by the novel use of altered tunings. There are very few formal accounts of percussive fingerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview study to investigate its approach to composition, performance and musical experimentation. Our aim was to gain insight into the technique from a gesture-based point of view, observe whether modern fingerstyle shares similarities to the approaches in NIME practice and investigate possible avenues for guitar augmentations inspired by the percussive technique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews: our findings highlight the participants' material-based approach to musical interaction and we present a three-zone model of the most common percussive gestures on the guitar's body. Furthermore, we examine current trends in Digital Musical Instruments, especially in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible future directions in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees' perspectives.}

  abstract = {In the field of human computer interaction (HCI) the limitations of prototypes as the primary artefact used in research are being realised. Prototypes often remain open in their design, are partially-finished, and have a focus on a specific aspect of interaction. Previous authors have proposed `research products' as a specific category of artefact distinct from both research prototypes and commercial products. The characteristics of research products are their holistic completeness as a design artefact, their situatedness in a specific cultural context, and the fact that they are evaluated for what they are, not what they will become. This paper discusses the ways in which many instruments created within the context of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), including those that are used in performances, often fall into the category of prototype. We shall discuss why research products might be a useful framing for NIME research. Research products shall be weighed up against some of the main themes of NIME research: technological innovation; musical expression; instrumentality. We conclude this paper with a case study of Strummi, a digital musical instrument which we frame as research product.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a micro-residency in a pop-up shop and collaborative making amongst a group of researchers and practitioners. The making extends to sound(-making) objects, instruments, workshop, sound installation, performance and discourse on DIY electronic music. Our research builds on creative workshopping and speculative design and is informed by ideas of collective making. The ad hoc and temporary pop-up space is seen as formative in shaping the outcomes of the work. Through the lens of curated research, working together with a provocative brief, we explored handmade objects, craft, non-craft, human error, and the spirit of DIY, DIYness. We used the Studio Bench - a method that brings making, recording and performance together in one space - and viewed workshopping and performance as a holistic event. A range of methodologies were investigated in relation to NIME. These included the Hardware Mash-up, Speculative Sound Circuits and Reverse Design, from product to prototype, resulting in the instrument the Radical Nails. Finally, our work drew on the notion of design as performance and making in public and further developed our understanding of workshop-installation and performance-installation.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for direct control using the voice via measurement of vocal muscular activation with surface electromyography (sEMG). Digital musical interfaces based on the voice have typically used indirect control, in which features extracted from audio signals control the parameters of sound generation, for example in audio to MIDI controllers. By contrast, focusing on the musculature of the singing voice allows direct muscular control, or alternatively, combined direct and indirect control in an augmented vocal instrument. In this way we aim to both preserve the intimate relationship a vocalist has with their instrument and key timbral and stylistic characteristics of the voice while expanding its sonic capabilities. This paper discusses other digital instruments which effectively utilise a combination of indirect and direct control as well as a history of controllers involving the voice. Subsequently, a new method of direct control from physiological aspects of singing through sEMG and its capabilities are discussed. Future developments of the system are further outlined along with usage in performance studies, interactive live vocal performance, and educational and practice tools.}

A co-developed, dedicated haptic interface is used to jointly control spectral and spatial attributes of the sound. Within a user study, participants were asked to create an individual mapping between control parameters of the interface and rendering parameters of sound synthesis and spatialization, using a visual programming environment. Resulting mappings of all participants are evaluated, indicating the preference of single control parameters for specific tasks. In comparison with mappings intended by the development team, the results validate certain design decisions and indicate new directions.}

  abstract = {The popularity of applying machine learning techniques in musical domains has created an inherent availability of freely accessible pre-trained neural network (NN) models ready for use in creative applications. This work outlines the implementation of one such application in the form of an assistance tool designed for live improvisational performances by laptop ensembles. The primary intention was to leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained NN models as a basis for assisting individual performers either as musical novices looking to engage with more experienced performers or as a tool to expand musical possibilities through new forms of creative expression. The system expands upon a variety of ideas found in different research areas including new interfaces for musical expression, generative music and group performance to produce a networked performance solution served via a web-browser interface. The final implementation of the system offers performers a mixture of high and low-level controls to influence the shape of sequences of notes output by locally run NN models in real time, also allowing performers to define their level of engagement with the assisting generative models. Two test performances were played, with the system shown to feasibly support four performers over a four minute piece while producing musically cohesive and engaging music. Iterations on the design of the system exposed technical constraints on the use of a JavaScript environment for generative models in a live music context, largely derived from inescapable processing overheads.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we present and evaluate Elemental, a NIME (New Interface for Musical Expression) based on audio synthesis of sounds of meteorological phenomena, namely rain, wind and thunder, intended for application in contemporary music/sound art, performing arts and entertainment. We first describe the system, controlled by the performer’s arms through Inertial Measuring Units and Electromyography sensors. The produced data is analyzed and used through mapping strategies as input of the sound synthesis engine. We conducted user studies to refine the sound synthesis engine, the choice of gestures and the mappings between them, and to finally evaluate this proof of concept. Indeed, the users approached the system with their own awareness ranging from the manipulation of abstract sound to the direct simulation of atmospheric phenomena - in the latter case, it could even be to revive memories or to create novel situations. This suggests that the approach of instrumentalization of sounds of known source may be a fruitful strategy for constructing expressive interactive sonic systems.}

The instrument is built around two Myo armbands located on the forearms of the performer. These are used to investigate muscle contraction, which is again used as the basis for the sonic interaction design. Using a practice-based approach, the aim is to explore the musical aesthetics of naturally occurring bioelectric signals. We are particularly interested in exploring the differences between processing at audio rate versus control rate, and how the level of detail in the signal–and the complexity of the mappings–influence the experience of control in the instrument. This is exemplified through reflections on four concerts in which RAW has been used in different types of collective improvisation.}

We developed the application SmartDrone to give users the freedom to practice in different harmonic settings with the assistance of their smartphone. This application further explores the area of dynamic accompaniment by implementing functionality so that chords are generated based on the key in which the user is playing. Since this app was designed to be a tool for scale practice, drone-like accompaniment was chosen so that musicians could experiment with combinations of melody and harmony. The details of the application development process are discussed in this paper, with the main focus on scale analysis and harmonic transposition. By using these two components, the application is able to dynamically alter key to reflect the user's playing. As well as the design and implementation details, this paper reports and examines feedback from a small user study of undergraduate music students who used the app. }

  abstract = {Previous research on musical embodiment has reported that expert performers often regard their instruments as an extension of their body. Not every digital musical instrument seeks to create a close relationship between body and instrument, but even for the many that do, the design process often focuses heavily on technical and sonic factors, with relatively less attention to the bodily experience of the performer. In this paper we propose Somaesthetic design as an alternative to explore this space. The Soma method aims to attune the sensibilities of designers, as well as their experience of their body, and make use of these notions as a resource for creative design. We then report on a series of workshops exploring the relationship between the body and the guitar with a Soma design approach. The workshops resulted in a series of guitar-related artefacts and NIMEs that emerged from the somatic exploration of balance and tension during guitar performance. Lastly we present lessons learned from our research that could inform future Soma-based musical instrument design, and how NIME research may also inform Soma design.}

Pre-packaged music AI software has the potential to broaden access to machine learning tools but it is unclear how widely these softwares are used by music technologists or how engagement affects attitudes towards AI in music making. To interrogate these questions we undertook a survey in October 2019, gaining 117 responses. The survey collected statistical information on the use of pre-packaged and self-written music AI software. Respondents reported a range of musical outputs including producing recordings, live performance and generative work across many genres of music making. The survey also gauged general attitudes towards AI in music and provided an open field for general comments. The responses to the survey suggested a forward-looking attitude to music AI with participants often pointing to the future potential of AI tools, rather than present utility. Optimism was partially related to programming skill with those with more experience showing higher skepticism towards the current state and future potential of AI.}

In doing so, it breaks from the linear representational conventions of European Art music and modern Digital Audio Workstations. A user specifies time points on different layers, each of which corresponds to a particular sound. The layers are superimposed on a single circle, which allows a unique visual perspective on the relationships between musical voices given their geometric positions. Positions in-between quantizations are possible, which encourages experimentation with expressive timing and machine rhythms. User-selected transformations affect groups of notes, layers, and the pattern as a whole. Past and future states are also represented, synthesizing linear and cyclical notions of time. This paper will contemplate philosophical questions raised by circular rhythmic notation and will reflect on the ways in which the representational novelties and editing functions of Cycle have inspired creativity in musical composition.}

Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music. While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples of popular music and how the organism's non-linear behaviour can be controlled while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster processing and performance. }
